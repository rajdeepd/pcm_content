# ASSIGNMENT

## Section - A
1. If a body is at rest. Can we say that no force is acting on the body?
2. What is meant by unbalanced force?
3. (i) Define inertia of motion.
(ii) Define inertia of direction.
4. Define the S.I. unit of force.
5. What is the relation between momentum and kinetic energy?
6. Define impulse.
7. A boy whose mass is $75 \mathrm{~kg}$ holds in his hands a bag weighing $40 \mathrm{~N}$. With what force does floor push up on his feet ? (take $\mathrm{g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ )
8. A force acts on a $2 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass $\&$ gives it an acceleration of $3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$. What acceleration is po by the same force when acting on a mass of
(a) $1 \mathrm{~kg}$
(b) $4 \mathrm{~kg}$
(c) How large is the force
9. Calculate the force required to move a car from rest to a velocity of $30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in 10 seconds mass of the car is $1500 \mathrm{~kg}$.
10. A $12 \mathrm{~g}$ bullet is accelerated from rest to a speed of $700 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ as it travels $20 \mathrm{~cm}$ in a git Assuming the acceleration to be constant, how large was the accelerating force?
11. How long will it take a force of $10 \mathrm{~N}$ to stop a mass of $2.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ which is moving at $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ ?
  
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \mathrm{a}=4 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s^2} \\
    & \mathrm{v}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
    & \mathrm{a}=\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{t}=\Rightarrow \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{a}=20 / 5=4 \text { seconds }
    \end{aligned}
    $$
12. Stone of $1 \mathrm{~kg}$ is thrown with a velocity of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ across the frozen surface of lake and ool rest after travelling a distance of $50 \mathrm{~m}$. What is the force of friction between the stone ord ice?
13. Calculate the change in momentum of a body weighing $5 \mathrm{~kg}$ when its velocity decreases $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ to $0.20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ ?
14. The $4 \mathrm{~kg}$ head of a sledge hammer is moving at $6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ when it strikes a spike dividing it into the duration of the impact is $2 \mathrm{~ms}$. find the time average of the impact force.
