# CHAPTER PRACTICE PROBLEMS

1. What is the C.G.S unit of linear momentum?
$N \cdot C$
2. What is linear momentum?
3. What do you mean by inertia of rest?
4. What is the mass of an object whose weight is $196 \mathrm{~N}$ ?
5. Why do passengers in a bus tend to fall backward when it starts suddenly? 1 - $\mathrm{C}$
6. State law of conservation of momentum.
7. What is normal reaction or normal force?
8. State Newton II law of motion.
9. What is the S.I. Unit of momentum?
19. Calculate the force required to produce an acceleration of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ in a body of mass $10 \mathrm{~kg}$
11. A bullet of mass $50 \mathrm{~g}$ is horizontally fired with a velocity of $35 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ from a pistol of mass $4 \mathrm{~kg}$. Calculate the recoil velocity of the pistol?
12. An $8000 \mathrm{~kg}$ engine pulls a train of 5 wagons, each of $2000 \mathrm{~kg}$, along a horizontal track. If the engine exerts a force of $40,000 \mathrm{~N}$ and the track offers a frictional force of $5000 \mathrm{~N}$, then calculate:
(a) the net accelerating force
(b) net acceleration (taking all the wagons as a system).
(c) the force of the wagon 1 on rest of the wagons
13. An object has a constant momentum of $2.45 \times 10^2 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Determine the momentum of the object if its mass decreases to $1 / 3$ of its original value and applied forces causes the speed to increased to exactly four times of the original. The direction of velocity remains same.
14. An object of mass $10 \mathrm{~kg}$ is accelerated uniformly from rest to a velocity of $8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in $6 \mathrm{~s}$, calculate the final momentum of the object
15. A steam engine of mass $3 \times 10^4 \mathrm{~kg}$ pulls two wagons each of mass $2 \times 10^4 \mathrm{~kg}$ with an acceleration of $0.2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$, neglecting frictional forces, calculate the <br/>
(i) force exerted by the engine <br/>
(ii) Net force experienced by each wagon. <br/>
