<h4>Numerical based questions (single digit answer 0 to 9 )</h4>

1. A block of wood floats in a liquid with three fifth of its volume submerged. If the relative density of wood is 0.3 , the density of the liquid in units of $\mathrm{kgm}^{-3}$ is $N \times 10^2$. Find $N$ ?
2. 'A' block of wood floats in a liquid with four-fifths of its vol. submerged. If the relative density of wood is 0.8 , What is the density of liquid is $500 \times \mathrm{k}\left(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3\right.$.) find K .
3. A body floats in water with $40 \%$ of its volume outside water. When the same body floats in oil, $60 \%$ of its volume remains outside oil. The relative density of oil is $0.3 \times \mathrm{k}$. Then find K
4. A 700 g solid cube having an edge of length 10 cm floats in water. The volume of cube outside the water is $100 \mathrm{k} \mathrm{cm}^3$. Find the value of k ?

5. A container of large uniform cross-sectional area A resting on a horizontal surface, holds two immiscible liquids of densities $d$ and $2 d$, each of height $\mathrm{H} / 2$ as shown in figure.
A homogeneous solid cylinder of length $L(L<H / 2)$, cross-sectional area $A / 5$ is immersed such that it floats with its axis vertical at the liquid-liquid interface with length $L / 4$ in the denser liquid. Determine the density $D$ of the solid.
6. A cubical iron block of side 10 cm is floating on mercury in a vessel.  
(i) What is the height of the block above the mercury level?  
(ii) Water is poured into vessel until it just covers the iron block. What is the height of the water column?  
Given that density of iron is $7.2 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{c} . \mathrm{c}$. and density of mercury $=13.6 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{c} . \mathrm{c}$.  
  **Solution:**   
  *(i)* $\rho_m \cdot x \cdot g = \rho_iron \cdot 10 \cdot g $  
     $ 13.6 \cdot x = 7.2 \cdot 10 $  
     $ x = 5.29 cm $  
  *(ii)* $ \rho_{fe} \cdot l \cdot g $ = $ \rho_w \cdot l \cdot g + \rho_{hg} \cdot (l-h) \cdot g $  
  $ \rho_{fe} \cdot l $ = $ \rho_w \cdot l  + \rho_{hg} \cdot l - \rho_{hg} \cdot (h)$

   $ h = \frac { \rho_w + \rho_{hg - \rho_{fe}}} {\rho_{hg}} \cdot l $



1. A piece of brass (alloy of copper and zinc) weighs 12.9 gram in air. When completely immersed in water it weighs 11.3 gram. What is the mass of copper contained in the alloy? Relative densities of copper and zinc are 8.9 and 7.1 respectively.

    Weight in air is $12.9 gm$  
    Weight in water is $11.3 gm$  
    Weight loss in water $1.6 gm$  
    Let mass of cu $m_1$ and zinc $m_2$  
    $m_1 + m_2 = 12.9$  
    $m_2 = 12.9 - m_1$  
    Apparent weight = 1.6  

    $ \frac{m_1}{8.9}$ +  $ \frac{m_2}{7.1}$ = 1.6  
    $ \frac{m_1}{8.9}$ +  $ \frac{12.9 - m_1}{7.1}$ = 1.6

    $7.1 \cdot m_1 + 12.9 \cdot 8.9 - 8.9 \cdot m_1 = 1.6 \cdot 8.9 \cdot 7.1$  
    $114.81 - 101.10 = 1.8 \cdot m_1$  
    $ m_1 =  7.61 $  


2. A metal piece of mass 160 g lies in equilibrium inside a glass of water as shown in the figure. The piece touches the bottom of the glass at a small number of points. If the density of the metal is 8000 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$, find the normal force exerted by the bottom of the glass on the metal.  




<b>Solution:</b>  
    Volume of the block = $0.16/8000 m^3$
    Force exerted by water upwards =$0.16/8$ = $0.0  \cdot 10$ = 0.2N  
    Weight of the object = $0.16 \cdot 10$ =  $1.6$ N  
    Net force = $1.4$ N
