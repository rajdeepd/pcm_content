Pascal's Law
If the pressure at a point in a liquid at rest is changed, the change is transmitted to the entire liquid without being diminished in magnitude.

It is also called as principle of transmission of fluid pressure.
Hydraulic press, hydraulic lift in industries and hydraulic brakes of automobiles work on Pascal's law.

Example :
The area of cross-section of two arms of a hydraulic press are $1 \mathrm{~cm}^2$ and 10 $\mathrm{cm}^2$. A force of 5 N is applied on the water in thinner arm. What force should be applied on thicker arm so that the water remains in equilibrium. (Neglect the effect of atmospheric pressure)

Solution:
Water remains in equilibrium if pressure on both arms is equal
i.e. $P_{\text {on thicker arm }}=P_{\text {on thinner amm }}$

$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\frac{F}{A}\right)_{\text {mikece amm }}=\left(\frac{F}{A}\right)_{\text {mimes ame }} \newline
& \frac{F}{10 \mathrm{~cm}^2}=\frac{5 \mathrm{~N}}{1 \mathrm{~cm}^2} \newline
& \Rightarrow F=50 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$
