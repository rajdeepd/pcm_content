## Introduction

Matter is basically divided into three categories, solids, liquids and gases. In solids, the intermolecular forces are strong, so that the shape and size of solids do not change easily. In liquids, this force is comparatively less and so the shape is easily changed. Even through the shape of a liquid can be easily changed, the volume of a given mass of liquid is not so easy to change. But in case of gases, since the intermolecular forces are very small, both the shape and density can be changed easily. Liquids and gases together are called fluids, i.e. that which can flow.

Pressure:
When a force acts perpendicularly on a surface and is uniformly distributed over an area A of the surface, then the pressure on the points over the area is defined as

$
P=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{\text { Force }}{\text { Area }}
$


Hence, pressure is the force acting perpendicularly on a unit area of the object.  
Unit of Pressure:
SI unit of pressure is Newton/metre ${ }^2\left(\mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\right)$ which is also called Pascal ( Pa$)$.
1 Pascal $=1 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2$.

### Pressure in a Liquid:  
The magnitude of the force exerted by a liquid on a surface inside it does not depend how the surface is tilted. Surface is horizontal, vertical or at any angle, the force has the same magnitude. It means the pressure at a given point in the liquid is uniquely defined. This force due to liquid acts normal to area, pressing the surface. There are two important rules regarding pressure in a liquid.  
(i). The pressure in a liquid is the same at all the points at the same horizontal level.  
(ii). The pressure increases with depth.  

In the figures, a solid rod immersed in a liquid is shown in three different cases. Consider the shaded surface in figures (a), (b) and (c).

 <figcaption align="center" font-size="6px">Fig.1 : Pressure on a object in a liquid</figcaption>
</figure>

In figure (1.a) surface of area a is horizontal and its centre is at point $A$ in the liquid. The force exerted by the liquid on this surface is in downward direction. Pressure at the point $A$ is $p=F / a$ where $F$ is the magnitude of the force.

In figure (1.b) the centre of the surface is still at the same point $A$, but the surface itself is now vertical. In this case again, pressure at point $A$ is $P=F /$, where $F$ is the magnitude of force towards right.
In figure (c) the considered surface is at the bottom. The force exerted by the liquid is now upwards. The centre of the surface is still at the same point A and the magnitude of the force is also same, and pressure at $A$ is $(P)=F / a$.
Thrust:
The total force acting normal to any given area which is immersed inside a liquid is also called thrust on the area.

The Mercury Barometer
Given figure 2 shows a very basic mercury barometer, a device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere.

</figure>

The long glass tube is filled with mercury and inverted with its end in a dish of mercury, as the figure shows.

The space above the mercury column (called Torricellian vacuum) contains only mercury vapour, whose pressure is so small at ordinary temperatures that it can be neglected ( $P_A=0$ ).

Let us consider a point $C$ on the mercury surface in the cup and another point $B$ in the tube at the same horizontal level. The pressure at C is equal to the atmospheric pressure. As B and C are in the same horizontal level, the pressure at B and C are equal. Thus, the pressure at B is equal to the atmospheric pressure in the lab.

$
\begin{array}{llll}
\therefore & & P_B=P_A+\rho g H \newline
\text { or } & P_B=\rho g H \quad\left[\because P_A=0\right]
\end{array}
$

where $\rho$ is the density of mercury and $H$ is depth of point $B$ below $A$.
At sea level $H=76 \mathrm{~cm}$

### Atmospheric Pressure:

The pressure at any place due to atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. Its value varies from place to place. The value of atmospheric pressure at the earth's surface near the sea level is approximately $1.01 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~Pa}$, which is also known as 1 atmospheric pressure (atm). Thus, atm is the unit of pressure.
$1 \mathrm{~atm}=$ pressure exerted by a mercury column of length $760 \mathrm{~mm}=760 \mathrm{~mm}$ of Hg .

### Exercise 1:
(i). The pressure inside a lliquid _______ with depth.   
(ii). The pressure difference between $A, B$ and $B, C$ is    
(A) zero, not zero  
(B) zero, zero  
(C) not zero, not zero  
(D) not zero, zero  
(iii). Force due to pressure acts always _______  to surface. 

Illustration 1:  
A force of 40 N is applied on a nail, whose tip has an area of cross-section of $0.001 \mathrm{~cm}^2$. Find the pressure on the tip.

Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Given that, } F=40 \mathrm{~N}, A=0.001 \mathrm{~cm}^2=10^{-7} \mathrm{~m}^2 \\
& \begin{aligned}
& \therefore \text { Pressure }(P)=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{40}{10^{-7}} \\
&=4 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{aligned}
$


Illustration 2:  
Atmospheric pressure is nearly 100 KPa . How large force does the air in a room exert on one side of a window of dimensions $40 \mathrm{~cm} \times 80 \mathrm{~cm}$ ?

Solution: Given that,

$
\begin{aligned}
& P=100 \mathrm{KPa}=100 \times 10^3 \mathrm{~Pa} \\
& P=10^5 \mathrm{~Pa} \\
& \text { And } A=40 \mathrm{~cm} \times 80 \mathrm{~cm}=40 \times 80 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~m}^2 \\
& \therefore F=P A=10^5 \times 40 \times 80 \times 10^{-4} \\
& \Rightarrow F=32 \mathrm{KN}
\end{aligned}
$

Illustration 3:  
A tank 5 m high is half filled with water and then is filled to the top with oil of density $0.85 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. What is the pressure at the bottom of the tank due to these liquid?

Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Pressure } & =\frac{\text { Total weight of water and liquid }}{\text { base area of tank }} \\
& =\frac{A \times \ell_w \times \rho_w \times g+A \times \ell_0 \times \rho_0 \times g}{A}=453250 \text { dyne } / \mathrm{cm}^2
\end{aligned}
$


### BUOYANT FORCE    
When an object is immersed in a liquid, it experiences an upward force due to the liquid due to this is looses weight. This upward force is called Buoyant force. Buoyant force is also known as upthrust.
1. When a piece of cork is held below the surface of water and then released, the cork immediately rises to the surface. It means some upward force is exerted by water on the cork which pushes it to the surface.
2. When a stone lying at the bottom of a pond is lifted up, it appears to be light as long as it is being lifted inside water. But as soon as the stone is lifted out of water into air, one feels it to be much heavier. It means some upward force acts on the stone when it is immersed in water and makes us feel lighter.

#### Cause of Buoyant Force:  

Consider a rubber ball dipped completely inside a liquid filled in a beaker. The liquid in contact with the ball exerts a force in perpendicular direction, pressing it. Therefore, the force on the surface near the topmost point $A$ is downwards, whereas on the surface near the lowest point, C it is upwards. The force on the surface near the point $B$ is towards the left and near the point $D$ is towards the right. Now, the forces acting on it are not equal in magnitude.

 <figure align="center">
   <img src="/pcm_content/class9/physics/fitjee-phase3-fluids/images/fluids1.4.png" width="45%"/>
  <figcaption align="center" font-size="8px">Fig.3 : Figure depicting pressure on a ball </figcaption>
</figure>


The point $C$ lies at a greater depth than point $A$. Therefore pressure at $C$ is larger than A . Consider equal areas near A and C . 
It means upwards force near $C$ is larger in magnitude than the downward force near $A$. Therefore, the forces exerted on different parts of the ball by the liquid are not balanced. Hence the resultant force exerted by the liquid acts in upward direction, which is called buoyant force.  

#### Factors Affecting Buoyant Force  

The magnitude of Buoyant force acting on an object immersed in a liquid depends on two factors:  


(i) **Volume of the Solid object immersed in the liquid**
As the volume of object immersed inside the liquid increases, the upward buoyant force increases. When the object is completely immersed in the liquid, the buoyant force becomes maximum.  
(ii) **Density of the liquid** in which the object is immersed As the density of liquid increases, the buoyant force exerted by the liquid also increases. e.g. sea-water has higher density than fresh water, therefore sea-water will exert more buoyant force on an object immersed in it than the fresh water.

### Exercise 2: 

(i). Buoyant force is due to $\qquad$ .
(ii). What are the factors on which buoyant force depends?
(iii). A cubical object is floating inside a liquid such that upper surface is just inside the liquid. Now it is gently pushed into the liquid so that it acquires a velocity v. Its nature of motion later would be?
(iv). Explain why it is easier to lift a stone in water than in air?

A weighing machine on which a beaker containing water is placed reads $w$. What happens to lts reading if some one keeps his hand so that only fingers are immersed in water?

Solution: $w$ increases. In this case though the total weight of hand is not acting on water, the hand apparently looses some weight equivalent to buoyant force i.e. the water gels pushed down with the same force. Hence w increases (by a magnitude equal to buoyant force)  

### ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE  

When a solid body is fully or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body, and this force has a magnitude equal to the weight of displaced fluid.  
In other words,Buoyant force acting on an object = Weight of the displaced fluid.

The force exerted by a fluid on a solid body dipped partially or fully in it is called the buoyant force. e.g. if only a part of the ball is inside the liquid, then it displaces a smaller volume of fluid. The volume of the fluid displaced is equal to the volume of that part of the ball which is inside the fluid. The net force exerted on the ball by the fluid is again in the upward direction and it is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.
This rule is also applicable for solids immersed in gases.

#### Floating Bodie:  
A body of weight $W$ is completely immersed in a liquid and released, and then the two forces acting on it are:  
(a) The weight $W$, of the body in downward direction.  
(b) Buoyant force $B$ exerted by the liquid in upward direction.

Therefore,  
(i). If $\mathrm{W}>\mathrm{B}$, then net force on the body is in downward direction and the body sinks. It reaches the bottom and stays there.  
(ii). If $B>W$, net force on the body will be in upward direction. Body will come to the surface and floats, with a part of it inside the liquid.  
(iii). For a floating body, to be in equilibrium, Weight of the liquid displaced = Weight of the body or $\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{W}$

Condition for Floatation in Terms of Densities:

For bodies with no air space:
An ice cube, a wooden block etc. are bodies with no air space. The condition for the flotation of such bodies can be expressed in terms of the densities of the bodies and the concerned liquids.
Suppose the volume of a body is $V$ and its density is $\rho$. It is completely immersed in a liquid of density $\sigma$.

Mass of the body $(M)=V_\rho$  
Weight of the body $(\mathrm{W})=\mathrm{Mg}=\mathrm{V}_{\rho g}$  
Volume of the displaced liquid $=\mathrm{V}$  
Mass of the displaced liquid $=\mathrm{V}_\sigma$  
Weight of the displaced liquid $=$ Force of buoyancy $(B)=V \sigma g$  
Body will come up and float if,

$
B>W \Rightarrow V_{\sigma g}>V_{\rho g}
$


Or, $\sigma>\rho$
$\Rightarrow$ Thus body floats, if the density of the body is less than that of the liquid.

For bodies with air space:

The shape of the body plays an important role in deciding whether it sinks or floats, e.g. A small needle made of stainless steel sinks in water, but a large bowl of same material and same density floats in water, Density of steel is much greater than that of water. This is because a bowl can displace a much greater volume of water than the volume of steel.

### Exercise 3: 

(i). A beaker containing water kept on a weighing machine weighs W. A body of weight $\omega$ is dropped in it. It is floating and experiencing a buoyant force $B$, then the reading of machine is  
(A) $W+\omega$  
(B) $W+B$  
(C) $W+\omega-B$  
(D) $W$  

(ii). A balloon tied to a thread connected to the bottom of beaker containing water is inside water. If the thread is cut, then it  
(A) moves up with uniform acceleration  
(B) moves down with uniform acceleration  
(C) it moves up with uniform speed  
(D) does not move  

(iii). A balloon tied to a thread whose other end is fixed to the bottom of a beaker is held such that the string is horizontal. The path traced by balloon if it is released is  
(A) horizontal  
(B) vertical  
(C) along the arc of a circle  
(D) straight line from initial to final position.

(iv). Why it is easier to swim in sea water than in the river water?

A solid floats in water with $3 / i^n$ of its volume below the surface of water. What is the density of the substance? (Density of water $=1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ )</font>

Solution: Let the volume and density of the solid be V and $\rho$ respectively.
Weight of the solid $=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{pg}}\right)$ Newton
Volume of block under water $=(3 \mathrm{~V} / 4) \mathrm{m}^3=$ volume of water displaced
Weight of water displaced $=\left(\frac{3 \mathrm{~V}}{4} \times 1000 \times \mathrm{g}\right) \mathrm{N}$
Since, weight of body $=$ weight of water displaced by it

$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore V_{\rho g}=\frac{3 V}{4} \times 1000 \times g \newline
& \text { or } \rho=\frac{3 \times 1000}{4} \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3 \newline
& \rho=750 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3 .
\end{aligned}

A solid sphere weighs 2.0 N in air and 1.6 N when totally immersed in water. What is the magnitude of the upthrust?</font>

Solution: $\quad$ Weight of sphere in air $=2.0 \mathrm{~N}$  
Weight of sphere in water $=1.6 \mathrm{~N}$  
Loss in weight of the sphere $=(2.0-1.6) \mathrm{N}=0.4 \mathrm{~N}$
$\therefore$ Buoyant Force (up thrust) $=$ Loss in the weight of sphere in water $=0.4 \mathrm{~N}$  

#### Apparent Weight:  
When a body is dipped in a liquid, the liquid exerts an upward force on it which is called buoyant force.
Due to which less force is needed to hold the body. This, weight of the body inside a liquid is called the apparent weight of the body. Apparent weight of a body dipped in a liquid is less than its true weight.

#### Relative Density or Specific Gravity:

Relative density of a substance is defined as the ratio of density of substance to water.

$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Relative density of a substance } & =\frac{\text { Density of the substance }}{\text { Density of water }} \newline
& =\frac{\text { wt. of bodyinair }}{\text { loss of wt. of bodyin water }} \newline
& =\frac{\text { wt. of body inair }}{\text { upthrust }} \newline
& =\frac{\text { wt.of body inair }}{\text { wt.of equal volume of water }}
\end{aligned}

Four fiths of a cylindrical block of wood floats inside a liquid. If the relative density of the wood is 0.7 , find the density of the liquid.

Solution:
Let V be the volume of the block.
Density of the block $=0.7 \times 1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
Volume of the block under the liquid $=\frac{4 \mathrm{~V}}{5}$
Weight of the body $=$ weight of the liquid displaced (since body floats)

$
\begin{aligned}
& V \times 700 \times g=\frac{4 V}{5} \times \rho \times g \newline
& \text { or, } \rho=\frac{5}{4} \times 700=875 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3

A solid sphere has a radius of 1.5 cm and a mass of 0.038 kg . What is the relative density of the sphere </font>

Solution:
Given that, $m=0.038 \mathrm{~kg}, \mathrm{r}=1.5 \mathrm{~cm}$
Volume of the sphere $(V)=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3=\frac{4}{3} \times 3.14 \times\left(1.5 \times 10^{-2}\right)^3=1.413 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}^3$
Density of the sphere $(\mathrm{d})=\frac{\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{0.038}{1.413 \times 10^{-5}}=2690 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$
$\therefore$ Relative density $=\frac{\text { density of substance }}{\text { density of water }}=\frac{2690 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3}{1000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3}=2.69$.

  <figcaption align="center" font-size="8px">Fig.7 : Loaded test tube 10 cm and 12 cm in water </figcaption>
</figure>

Solution: $\quad$ Let the cross section of the tube be $=\mathrm{Acm}^2$ and the density of the liquid be $\mathrm{d} \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^3$ and that of water $d_1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^3$.

Mass of liquid displaced = volume displaced $\times$ density of liquid $=\mathrm{A} \times 10 \times \mathrm{d}$ grams
Mass of water displaced $=\mathrm{A} \times 12 \times \mathrm{d}_1$ grams   
Mass of liquid displaced $=$ Mass of water displaced (Since test-tube floats)  
i.e. $A \times 10 \times d=A \times 12 \times d_1$  
or, $\frac{d}{d_1}=\frac{12}{10}=1.2$  
But $\frac{d}{d_1}$ is specific gravity $=1.2$  
Hence relative density of the liquid $=1.2$

 The weight of a solid is 80 g in air and 50 g in a liquid of relative density 1.5. Calculate the relative density of the solid. </font>

Solution:
Weight of solid in air $=80 \mathrm{~g}$
Weight of solid in liquid $=50 \mathrm{~g}$
$\therefore$ Loss of weight of solid in liquid $=(80-50) \mathrm{g}=30 \mathrm{~g}$
Weight of equal volume of liquid by Archimedes principle $=30 \mathrm{~g}$
If the displaced liquid has a volume of $V \mathrm{~cm}^3$, then its weight $=\mathrm{V} \times 1.5=30 \mathrm{~g}$

$
\therefore \mathrm{V}=20 \mathrm{~cm}^3
$


Since solid is completely immersed in liquid, so volume of solid $=\mathrm{V}$
The volume of water that will be displaced by same solid $=20 \mathrm{~cm}^3$
$\therefore$ Weight of this displaced water $=20 \mathrm{~g}$
So we have specific gravity of solid $=\frac{\text { wt. of solidinair }}{\text { wt. of water displaced }}=\frac{80 \mathrm{~g}}{20 \mathrm{~g}}=4$.
