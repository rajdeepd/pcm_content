1. Define density.
2. Define relative density.
3. What is the S.I unit of density?
4. How many pascals are there in 10 kPa ?
5. Convert 1 Pa into bar?
6. What is S.I unit of thrust?
7. Convert $1 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ into $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^3$ ?
8. Relative density of a liquid is 2.3 , what is its density in S.I system?
9. What is the length of water column that can exert 1 atm pressure?
10. What is the unit of relative density?
11. A boat floating in a tank is carrying passengers. If the passengers drink some water, what will happen to the water level of the tank?
12. The ratio of height of mercury column in a barometer at a given place to height of the liquid column at the same place are $1: 4$. Find the density of the liquid?
13. A block of wood floats in a liquid of density $0.8 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{cm}^3$ with one fourth of its volume sub merged. In oil the block floats with $60 \%$ of its volume submerged. Find the density of
(a) wood
(b) oil.
14. Find the ratio between the depths where the pressures are $3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2 \& 5 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2$. (Patm $\left.\approx 10^5 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}^2\right)$
15. A ping pong ball has a volume $v$ and density $\frac{1}{7}$ th that of liquid. What force would be required to hold it completely inside the liquid. $\rho$ is the density of liquid.
