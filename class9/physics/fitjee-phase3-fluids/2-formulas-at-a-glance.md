1. The total force acting perpendicular on a given surface is called thrust.
2. Thrust acting upon a unit area is called pressure and denoted by ' $P$ '.

   Thus,
   $$
   \text { Pressure }=\frac{\text { Thrust }}{\text { Area of contact }}
   $$

   S.I. unit of pressure is $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}^2$ which is known as pascal ( Pa$)$.
3. Density of a substance is the mass of the substance contained in a unit volume of that substance. Density of an object is given as mass/volume.
or

$$
\mathrm{d}=\frac{\text { Mass }}{\text { Volume }}
$$

4. Buoyancy can be defined as the tendency of the fluid to exert an upward force on an object, which is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid.
5. The upward force that acts on an object when immersed in a fluid is called buoyant force.
6. The S.I. unit of buoyant force is newton.
7. Two main factors on which the buoyant force depends are:
(i) Density of the fluid. (ii) Value of acceleration due to gravity at that place.
8. When an iron nail is placed on the surface of water is sinks whereas ship made up of iron floats. This is because average density of nail is more than that of ship.
9. If the density of the liquid is more than the density of the material of the body then the body floats due to the buoyant force exerted by it and vice-versa.
10. All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid. Buoyant force experienced by a body when submerged in a liquid depends on the volume of the body and the density of the liquid.
11. Two forces act on an object immersed in water. One is the gravitational force (weight), which pulls the object downwards, and the other is the buoyant force, which pushes the object upwards. If the upward buoyant force is greater than the downward gravitational force (weight), then the object comes up to the surface of the water.
