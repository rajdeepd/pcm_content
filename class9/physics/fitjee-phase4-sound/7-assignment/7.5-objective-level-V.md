    #### Multiple Choice Questions (Single Option Correct-Assertion Reasoning Type)


    1. B  
Let's analyze the assertion and the reason:

**Assertion:** "Intensity of a wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude."

This statement is **correct**. The intensity of a wave (whether it's a sound wave, light wave, or any other type of wave) is indeed proportional to the square of its amplitude. Mathematically, this is often represented as:

Intensity (I) ∝ Amplitude² (A²)

**Reason:** "Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the medium particle from the mean position."

This statement is also **correct**. This is the fundamental definition of amplitude in the context of waves. The amplitude represents the maximum extent to which a particle in the medium oscillates from its equilibrium (or mean) position.

**Relationship between Assertion and Reason:**

The reason accurately defines what amplitude is, but it **does not explain why** the intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. The relationship between intensity and the square of the amplitude stems from the energy transported by the wave. The energy is proportional to the square of the velocity and the velocity is proportional to the amplitude.

**Conclusion:**

*   Both the Assertion and the Reason are correct.
*   However, the Reason doesn't provide the explanation for the Assertion being correct. It is simply a definition and does not explain the relationship between intensity and amplitude.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(B) If both Assertion and Reason are correct, but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.**
