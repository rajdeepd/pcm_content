# FORMULAS AND CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE 
1. Wave motion may be defined as a form of disturbance which is due to the repeated periodic vibrations of the particles of the medium about their mean positions and the motion is handed over from one particle to the other without any net transport of the medium.
2. We can classify waves in two categories on the basis of necessity of material medium for their propagation.
  (i). Non Mechanical Waves: The waves which do not require medium for their propagation
  (ii). Mechanical Waves: The waves which require medium for their propagation.

    Now we can further classify mechanical waves in two parts on the basis of particle and wave motion.
    (a). Transverse Waves: If the particles of medium vibrate about their mean position in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, wave is called transverse wave.
    (b). Longitudinal Waves: If the particles of medium vibrate about their mean positions in the direction of wave propagation, the wave is called longitudinal waves.
3. Relation between Time Period and Frequency

   The frequency $v$ of the wave is reciprocal of its time period.

    $
    v=\frac{1}{T}
    $

4. Relation Between Wave Velocity, Frequency and Wavelength

    $
    \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{v} \mathrm{\lambda}
    $

5. ECHO (Reflection Phenomenon): The reflection of sound, which causes the repetition of same sound wave, is called echo. For echo the two sound wave heard by eardrum must have a minimum time lag of 0.1 second because sensation of each sound wave lasts or persists in our brain for 0.1 second, even after the source of sound has stopped vibrating, Minimum distance required for echo phenomena is 16.5 m and the time interval should be greater than 0.1 second.

### Additional Formulas


1. The period of a seconds pendulum is approximately 2 seconds. A seconds pendulum is defined as a pendulum whose period is exactly two seconds; one second for a swing in one direction and one second for the return swing.

2. Time period of a simple pendulum and Length

        \begin{aligned}
        & T=2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{~L}}{g}} \newline
        & \Rightarrow L \propto T^2 \text { (Equation of parabola) }
        \end{aligned}
