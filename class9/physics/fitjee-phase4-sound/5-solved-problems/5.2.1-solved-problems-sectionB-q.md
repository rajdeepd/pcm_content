**Problem 1:** Two bobs of masses 1 kg and 2 kg are suspended from a rigid support by threads of lengths 4 m and 1 m respectively. Find the ratio of their time periods.


**Problem 2:** A simple pendulum has a time period of 1.0 sec at the earth's surface. It is taken to a height $R_\theta / 2$ above the earth's surface, where $R_\theta$ is the radius of the earth. Find the time period.


**Problem 3:** A car approaches a hill with a constant speed. When it is at a distance of 0.96 km it blows a whistle, whose echo is heard by the driver 6 sec later. If the speed of sound in air is 300 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$, Calculate the speed of car?


**Problem 4:** Helmet of a construction worker falls from height 78.4 m above the ground. He hears the sound of the helmet hitting the ground 4.23 seconds after it falls. Find the speed of sound in air.

**Problem 5:** A ship explodes on the surface of the sea. At the same instant an aircraft \& a submarine are present vertically above and below the ship, at equal distances from it. Find the ratio of the times taken by the sound waves to reach them.  
(speed of sound in air $=340 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$., speed of sound in sea water $=1520 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.)
