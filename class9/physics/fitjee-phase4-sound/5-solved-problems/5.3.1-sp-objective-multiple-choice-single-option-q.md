### Multiple Choice Questions (Single Option Correct)

**Problem 1**. The distance between a consecutive crest and trough is $x$. The wavelength of the wave is  
(A) $2 x$  
(B) $\frac{x}{2}$  
(C) $x$  
(D) $4 x$  

**Solution**: $\quad$ The wavelength of the wave is $2 x$  
Hence option (A) is correct.

**Problem 2**. The velocity of sound in air at room temperature is about  
(A) $332 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(B) $468 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(C) $232 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(D) $618 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  

**Problem 3**. The upper limit of frequency of sound waves audible to human beings are  
(A) 5 Hz  
(B) 20 Hz  
(C) $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$  
(D) $35,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$  

## Level - III

### Multiple Choice Questions (Single Option Correct)

**Problem 1**. A pulse is generated at one end of the slinky of length 10 m . The pulse returns back to its point of generation in 10 seconds. The velocity of the pulse in the slinky will be:  
(A) $4 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(B) $3 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(C) $2 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  
(D) $1 \mathrm{~ms}^{-1}$  

**Problem 2**. A longitudinal pulse is produced in a slinky. The frequency of the pulse is 60 Hz and it travels at a speed of $3 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$. the separation between consecutive compressions is :  
(A) 90 cm  
(B) 0.5 cm  
(C) 2 cm  
(D) 1.25 cm  


Comment by Rajdeep: These options are wrong if speed was 30 cm/s then it will come to 0.5 cm
