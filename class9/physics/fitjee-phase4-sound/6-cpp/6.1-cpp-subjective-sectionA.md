1.  
2. We are given the frequency of the ultrasonic waves (f = 4.5 MHz) and the speeds of sound in tissue (v_tissue = 1.5 km/s = 1500 m/s) and air (v_air = 340 m/s). We need to find the wavelength in both media.

    The relationship between speed (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ) is:
    v = fλ

    First, convert the frequency from MHz to Hz:
    f = 4.5 MHz = 4.5 x 10^6 Hz

    In tissue:
    λ_tissue = v_tissue / f
    λ_tissue = 1500 m/s / (4.5 x 10^6 Hz)
    λ_tissue = (1/3) x 10^-3 m = 0.33 x 10^-3 m = 0.33 mm ≈ 3.33 x 10^-4 m

    In air:
    λ_air = v_air / f
    λ_air = 340 m/s / (4.5 x 10^6 Hz)
    λ_air = (340/4.5) x 10^-6 m ≈ 75.56 x 10^-6 m ≈ 7.56 x 10^-5 m = 0.0756 mm

    Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{3.33e-4 , 7.56e-5}$

3. $\lambda = 0.15 \times 4 = 0.6$  
   $ \nu = \frac{1}{0.6} = \mathrm{1.66} \mathrm{hz} $

4. .

5. Time taken to complete 1.5 cycles = 15 secs, time take to complete one cycle is 10 sec. Hence frequence = 1/T  
   $ \nu = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1 \mathrm{ hz}$

6. v = 1600; T = 0.5 sec
   $ v = \nu \times \lambda $  
   $ v = 2 d / T $ 
   $ 2d = v \times T  $  
   $ d =  \frac{v}{2 \times T} $  
   $ d = \frac {1600} { 2} = 800 \mathrm{m} $

7. $0 \degree $ as both are in the same direction

8. Speed of sound in air is 343 m/s,  
   Time taken for stone to reach water $s = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 $   
   $ t^2 = \frac{2s}{g} = \frac{1000}{10} $
   $ t_1 =  10 sec $
   $ t_2 = \frac{2d}{V} = \frac{500}{343} $  
   $ t_2 = 1.46 \mathrm{ s} $   
   $ t = t_1 + t_2 = 10+ 1.46 = 11.46 \mathrm{ s} $ 


9. The speed of a wave in a certain medium is $960 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. If 3600 waves pass over a certain point of the medium in 1 minute. What will be the wavelength?  
     $ V = 960 m/s $     
     $ \text{3600 waves take 60 secs,} \newline
       1 \text{ wave takes} = 60/3600 = 1/60 secs \\
       \nu = 60 hz \\
       => \lambda =  \frac{V}{\nu} = \frac{960}{60} = 16 \text{ } \mathrm{m}
   $
10. Longitudnal and non mechanical
11. $ \lambda = \frac{352}{384} =  \mathrm{.91} \text{ m}$  
    $ \text{Distance travelled in 36 vibrations}  = 0.91 \times 36 = 33 m $

12. $ \lambda = ? $
    $ \nu = 60000 hz $
    $ V = 330 m/s $
    $ \lambda = 330/60000 = 0.0055 m $

   
13. The phase difference between two successive crests is **2π radians** or **360 degrees**.

14. Sound intensity is the power carried by sound waves per unit area.  It represents the amount of sound energy passing through a unit area per unit time.  A higher intensity sound carries more energy and is perceived as louder.

Its SI unit is the **watt per square meter (W/m²)**.  Sometimes you'll also see it expressed in decibels (dB), but decibels are a logarithmic scale relative to a reference intensity, not a direct measure of intensity itself.

15. The difference between longitudinal and transverse waves lies in the direction of particle oscillation relative to the direction of wave propagation:

* **Longitudinal Wave:** In a longitudinal wave, the particles of the medium vibrate *parallel* to the direction the wave is traveling.  Think of a slinky being pushed and pulled; the coils move back and forth along the length of the slinky, which is also the direction the wave travels.  Sound waves are a classic example of longitudinal waves.

* **Transverse Wave:** In a transverse wave, the particles of the medium vibrate *perpendicular* (at right angles) to the direction the wave is traveling.  Imagine shaking a rope up and down; the rope moves up and down (perpendicular to the direction the wave travels along the rope's length).  Light waves are a classic example of transverse waves.
