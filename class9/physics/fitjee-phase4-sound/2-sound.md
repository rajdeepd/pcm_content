# SOUND
Sound is a form of energy which travels in the medium in form of pressure waves. These waves in the form of compression and rarefaction create sensation at our ears which enables us to hear it.

## Properties of Sound Waves

Sound is produced by vibration. For example when we speak our voice creates vibration in air near to it. In music instrument (like Sitar, Tabla, Guitar etc.), the sound is produced due to vibration created in air by vibrating string or membranes.
Sound waves are mechanical in nature, hence they need materialistic medium to travel. Sound wave can travel in liquid, solid and gas but not in vacuum.

Sound waves are longitudinal in nature. Hence when it travels, compression and rarefaction pulses are produced in medium in the direction of sound propagation.

**Exercise 3:**
Can we talk on moon as on earth? If not, how astronauts can communicate among each other at moon?

### Speed of Sound
Sound waves move in a medium with a finite speed. It takes finite time to travel a distance. Its speed depends on the properties of medium such as temperature, pressure, elasticity etc in which it is traveling. At $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the speed of sound in air is $344 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and in water is $1482 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ while in copper is $3750 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, hence generally speed of sound increases as density of material increases.

**Exercise 4:**

(i). If we put our ear to a railway line, we can hear the sound of an approaching train even when the train is far off but its sound can not be heard through the air, why?   
(ii). When it is raining we first see the flash of light in air, then hear the sound of thunder. Explain why?  

## Sensation of Sound to Human Ear
The appearance of sound to human ear is characterized by three parameters (a) Pitch (b) Loudness (c) Quality.

(a). Pitch

Pitch of a sound is the sensation by which we can differentiate male voice and a female voice.
Thus sensation depends on the dominate frequency present in sound.

(b). Loudness and Intensity

It is degree of sensation due to which we distinguish between a loud and a faint sound.

(c). Quality

We differentiate between the sound from a Tabla and Gitar by saying that they have different qualities. Musical sound have well-defined frequencies or harmonic due to this we can recognize them.

### Range of Hearing for Human beings
The range of frequency varying from 20 Hz to $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ is known as the frequency range of hearing in humans. This frequency range is called audible range of frequency.
The sound waves of frequency lower then 20 Hz are known as Infrasonic Sound.
The sound waves of frequency higher than $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ are known as Ultrasonic Sound.

### SONIC BOOM

When an object moves in air with a speed greater than the speed of sound in air, it is said to be traveling with supersonic speed. For example: Jet fighters, Bullets etc. often travel with supersonic speed.

**Exercise 5: $\square$**

A medium carrying a sound wave receives compression pulse at every 0.02 sec . The time period of wave is $\qquad$ and the frequency of the source is $\qquad$ .

**IIlustration 5 :**  A sound wave of frequency 600 Hz travels in air with speed $300 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Now this sound wave refracts in a medium where its speed becomes $900 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Find  
(a) wavelength in air.  
(b) frequency in medium.  
(c) wavelength in medium.  

Solution:  
(a) Case-I, when sound travels in air

$$
\text { Wavelength } \lambda_{\mathrm{a}}=\frac{\operatorname{speed}(\mathrm{v})}{\text { frequency }(\mathrm{f})}=\frac{300}{600}=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~m}=50 \mathrm{~cm}
$$

(b) Case II, when sound travels in medium; We know frequency of wave does not change when it goes from one medium to another medium.

$
\therefore \quad \mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{m}}=\mathrm{f}_{\mathrm{a}}=600 \mathrm{~Hz}
$

(c) Wavelength $\lambda_m=\frac{\text { Speed in medium }\left(v_m\right)}{\text { Frequency }\left(f_m\right)}=\frac{900}{600} \mathrm{~m}=150 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Illustration 6 :**
A sound wave has time period $10^{-3} \mathrm{sec}$ and wavelength $10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$.
(a) Find the time taken by the wave to travel 50 m .
(b) If the wave pattern continues in this distance, find the number of rarefactions and compressions formed.

Solution:
(a) Frequency of wave $v=1 / T$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{T}=10^{-3} \mathrm{sec} \newline
& \therefore \quad v=\frac{1}{10^{-3}}=1000 \mathrm{~Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$


Wave speed $v=v \lambda$ and $\lambda=10^{-2} \mathrm{~m}$
Speed $v=10^{-2} \times 10^3=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
The time taken by wave to travel 50 m is

$
\mathrm{t}=\frac{\mathrm{x}}{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{50}{10}=5 \mathrm{sec}
$

(b) Number of rarefactions $(\mathrm{n})=$ number of compressions $=\frac{\mathrm{x}}{\lambda}=\frac{50}{10^{-2}}$

$
=50 \times 10^2=5000 .
$

## REFLECTION OF SOUND

Sound, like light also gets reflected at the surface where medium changes. Reflection of sound follows the law of reflection of light.

### Echo

If we shout in a big empty hall, we hear again our voice coming due to reflection of sound from wall a little later. This phenomenon is known as echo.


### Minimum Distance to Hear an Echo

Our ears distinguish two sounds separately only if there is a minimum time interval of $\frac{1}{10}^{\text {th }}$ of a second. Now, by knowing the minimum time interval required for an echo to be heard, and the speed of sound in air, we can calculate the minimum distance from a sound reflecting surface, which is necessary to hear an echo.

$
\text { Speed }=\frac{\text { Dis tance travelled }}{\text { Time taken }}
$

<img src="./images/minimum-distance.png" width="40%"/>

Now, speed of sound $=344 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
Distance traveled $=2 \mathrm{~d}$

$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Time gap }=\frac{1}{10} \newline
& 2 \mathrm{~d}=344 \times \frac{1}{10} \newline
& \therefore \text { from (i), } 2 \mathrm{~d}=344 \times \frac{1}{10} \newline
& d=17.2 \text { metre. }
\end{aligned}
$

**Illustration 7 :**
A boy hears an echo of his own voice from a distant hill after one second. The speed of sound in air is $350 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. What is the distance of hill from the boy?

Solution: Let d be the distance of hill from the boy.  
Total distance travelled by the sound in going and coming back $=2 \mathrm{~d}$  
Now speed of sound $=\frac{\text { Totaldistance travelled }}{\text { timetaken }}$  
$\therefore V=\frac{2 d}{t} \quad$ or, $\quad d=\frac{V \times t}{2} \quad$ or, $\quad d=\frac{350 \times 1}{2}=175 m$.  

**Illustration 8 :**
A boy standing in front of a wall at a distance of 85 m produces 2 claps per second. He notices that the sound of his clapping coincides with the echo. The echo is heard only once when clapping is stopped. Calculate the speed of sound.

Solution: Let d be the distance of wall from the boy. To hear the echo, sound has to travel a total distance $=2 \mathrm{~d}=2 \times 85=170 \mathrm{~m}$.
Since 2 claps are produced in one second, therefore each clap is produced after $1 / 2 \mathrm{sec}$ which is equal to the time take for the echo to be heard (according to the question)
i.e. $t=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{~s}=0.5 \mathrm{~s}$

Now the speed of sound

$
\mathrm{V}=\frac{\text { Total distance travelled }}{\text { time taken }}=\frac{170 \mathrm{~m}}{0.5 \mathrm{~s}}=340 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$

### Reverberation
In a hall, when sound is created, the listener hears the direct waves reaching him. But the waves have spread all over the hall and after being reflected from various points in the hall, keep on returning to the same listener. Thus the intensity of sound goes on building up till a saturation is reached. When the energy received is equal and opposite to the energy absorbed or strayed out of window etc. After the sound is stopped, it takes some time to die down. Thus, due to the continued reflections of sound in the halls or auditoriums, sound keeps on persisting for some time even after it is stopped. This persistence of sound is called the reverberation (Goonj). As soon as the sound is created we start counting time and stop when the sound has fallen to $10^{-6}$ of the original intensity and thus becomes inaudible. This time interval is known as the time of reverberation. In large circular domes like the one at Taj Mahal at Agra, the reverberation time may be as large as 25 second; while in well cushioned rooms, when curtains etc. are being used and open windows are kept, this reverberation time may be as low as 0.1 second.
### Use of Multiple Reflection of Sound:
(i) In stethoscopes, the sound of a patient's heartbeat is guided along the tube of the stethoscope to the doctor's ear by multiple reflections of sound.  

<img src="./images/stethoscope.png"/>

(ii) Horns, musical instruments such as trumpets and shehanais, lounhailers (megaphones), loudspeakers etc. Are all designed similarly to keep sound from spreading in all directions. In these instruments a tube followed by a conical opening reflects sound successively to guide most of the sound waves from the source in the forward direction, towards the audience. The sound wave add up and the loudness of sound increases.
 
<img src="./images/musical-instruments.png"/>

(iii) Generally the ceilings of concert halls, conference halls and cinema halls are curved so that sound after reflection reaches all corners of the hall, as shown in figure. Sometimes a curved sound board may be placed behind the stage so that the sound after reflecting from the sound board spreads evenly across the width of the hall.

### ULTRASOUND AND ITS APPLICATIONS
A compression and rarefaction wave in a material medium with frequencies above 20 kHz is known as an ultrasonic wave or ultrasound. These waves can travel quite freely in solids and liquids.

However, their intensity drops drastically in gases. Because of their high frequency ultrasonic wave have some special properties.

#### Properties of ultrasonic waves:
High Power: The energy of a wave depends on several factors, including its frequency. Due to its high frequency an ultrasonic wave can be made very powerful. The high power of ultrasonic waves is used in industry and medicine to break and cut objects.

Good directionality:
Ultrasonic waves are able to travel along well defined straight paths, even in the presence of obstacles. Therefore, they are used for imaging objects.

#### Industrial Applications of Ultrasonic Waves:
Ultrasounds are used extensively in industries and for medical purposes.
Drilling holes or making cuts of desired shape:
In metal plates, plastic sheets or other solid materials, holes can be made using Ultrasonic vibrations produced in a metallic rod, called a horn. 

<img src="./images/ultrasound-horn-plate.png"/>

The horn acts like a hammer, hammering the plate about a hundred thousand times per second. The shape of the hole will be same as that of the tip of the horn.

##### Ultrasonic Cleaning:
Ultrasound is generally used to clean parts located in hard to reach places, e.g. spiral tube, electronic components etc. Such objects are placed in a cleaning solution and ultrasonic waves are sent into the solution, Because of vibrations at high frequencies all dirt and greater particles get detached from the surface and the objects get thoroughly cleaned.


Ultrasonic detection of defects in metals
Ultrasounds can be used to detect cracks and flaws in metal blocks. Metallic components are used in buildings bridges, machines, scientific equipment and so on. If there are cracks or holes inside the metal used, the strength of the structure or component is reduced and it can fail. Such defects are not visible from the outside. Ultrasonic waves can be used to detect such defects.

<img src="./images/ultrasound-metal-detection.png"/>

Ultrasonic waves are sent through the metallic objects under study. If there is no crack or cavity in its path, it goes through the object. A detector placed on the other side defects the transmitted wave. A defect present in the path of the wave reflects the wave. Thus, the intensity of the emerging wave falls in the region that is in line with the defect. This shows that the object has a defect inside.

##### Medical Applications of Ultrasound:

###### Imaging of Organs:

Echocardiography is a technique in which ultrasonic waves, reflected from various parts of the heart, form an image of the heart. Ultrasonography is also used to show images of a patient's organs by the doctors.
These applications are based on the high directionality of ultrasound waves and their capability to reflect from the boundaries between different kinds of materials. Ultrasonic waves of low intensity are sent to the desired area of the body. The waves travel along straight lines till they hit an internal structure. A part of the wave is reflected from here, and the rest is transmitted to the next structure. It is again reflected at the next boundary and so on. Waves are sent from different angles and all the reflected waves are gathered by a receiver. These waves are then converted into electrical signals that are used to generate images of an organ. These images are then displayed on a monitor, and if required printed on film.

###### Surgical use of Ultrasound:

Ultrasound may be employed to break small 'stones' formed in the kidneys into fine grains. These grains later get flushed out with urine.

### SONAR
The 'SONAR' is abbreviated form of Sound Navigation and Ranging. The SONAR system is used for detecting the presence of unseen objects under water such as a submerged submarine, a sea-rock or hidden iceberg, and locating them accurately.

The SONAR employs ultrasonic waves for working. Due to its very high frequency, ultrasonic sound has a grater penetrating power than ordinary sound. These waves have frequency more than $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$.
A SONAR apparatus consists of two parts (i) a transmitter (b) a receiver.
A SONAR device is attached to the ship and with its help we can measure the depth of an object lying at the bottom of sea. To do this, the transmitter sends ultrasonic waves into sea. This wave is reflected from bottom of sea to the ship in the form of an echo. This echo produces an electrical signal in the receiver part of the SONAR device.

Let the time interval recorded between transmission and reflection of ultrasonic signal be $t$ and object is at a depth $h$ below water level then

$
\Rightarrow \quad \begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{~h}=\mathrm{v} \times \mathrm{t} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{speed} \text { of sound waves in water. } \newline
& \mathrm{h}=\mathrm{vt} / 2
\end{aligned}
$


In nature too, the principle of the SONAR is used by bat. A bat can hear ultrasonic sounds of frequencies upto 120 KHz .

**Illustration 9 :**
A sonar system attached to ship, picks up a reflected signal after 2.5 sec . find the depth of sea at that location? Speed of sonar signal in water is $1500 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Let depth of sea level }=\mathrm{h} \newline
& \text { Distance travel by signal }=2 \mathrm{~h} \newline
& \text { Now distance travelled } 2 \mathrm{~h}=\mathrm{t} \times \mathrm{v} \newline
& \quad=2.5 \times 1500 \newline
& \Rightarrow \mathrm{~h}=1875 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$
$\sigma$. 

**Illustration 10 :**

A sonar system is attached to submarine which is moving inside the sea. It sends signal, which is reflected by a bird flying at height of 165 m from sea level. If sonar system receives the reflected signal from bird after 1.5 sec . Find the depth of submarine from sea level. (Speed of ultrasonic sound in air 330 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ and in water is $1200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ )

$1.5-y \times 330 +  y \times 1200$

$2h = v.t$
$t = 330/330 = 1 sec$
$time in water = 0.5 sec$

$2h = 1200 \times 0.5$
$h = 300 m $
