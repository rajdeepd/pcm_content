$\sigma$ Illustration 1 :
Find the frequency and wavelength of a wave whose time period is 0.05 sec and speed is $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

$\sigma$ Illustration 2 :
A source produces 12 waves in 3 sec . The distance between a crest and a consecutive trough is 6 m .
Find (a) frequency (b) wavelength
(c) velocity of wave

$\sigma$ Illustration 3 :
Sound wave travel with a speed of about $330 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. What is the wavelength of sound whose frequency is 550 hertz?

$\sigma$ Illustration 4 :
The frequency of a transeverse wave is 25 kHz . Its speed in air and oil are $500 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and $1500 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ respectively. Find lts wavelength in air and the oil.
