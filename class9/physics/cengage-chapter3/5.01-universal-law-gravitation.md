## Introduction

In the universe, all objects attract each other with a gravitational force of attraction. The interactions causedde the gravitation do not simply exist between the Earth and the Sun or the Sun and other objects. It is univerd: gravitational interactions exist between all the objects with an intensity that is directly proportional to the prods their masses. Newton gave the universal law of gravitation that helped in explaining phenomena like trajectory of  comets, the occurrence of tides on the Earth, etc.

## Universal Law of Gravitation

Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe withy which depends on the masses of the particles and the distance between them.
According to Newton, the force of attraction acting between two particles is directly proportional to the prode their masses $\left(F \propto m_1 m_2\right)$ and inversely proportional to the square of distance between them $\left(F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}\right)$. This force directed along the line joining the two particles.

In the figure, there are two particles of masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ at separation $r$. The force with which $m_1$ attracts $m_2$ is $F_{12}$, and the force with which $m_2$ attracts $m_1$ is $F_{21}$.


EXAMPLES

1. The magnitude of the gravitational force between the Earth and an object on its surface is 9.8 N . Find the mass of the object? (Mass of the Earth is $6 \times 10^{24} \mathrm{~kg}$ and radius of the Earth is $6.4 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~m}$ )
Solution: The gravitational force between the Earth and 1 kg body on its surface is given by

   $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & F=\frac{G M_e M_b}{R^2} \\
    & 9.8=\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 6 \times 10^{24} \times M_b}{\left(6.4 \times 10^5\right)^2} \\
    & 9.8=\frac{6.67 \times 10^{-11} \times 6 \times 10^{24} \times M_b}{6.4 \times 6.4 \times 10^{12}}
    \end{aligned}
   $$

    This gives, $M_b=1 \mathrm{~kg}$

2. How does the force of gravitational between two objects changes when the distance between them is doubled?
Solution: Force of gravitation, $F \propto \frac{1}{R^2}$. If $R$ is doubled (i.e., $R^{\prime}=2 R$ ) $2 R$, then $F^{\prime} \propto \frac{1}{\left(R^{\prime}\right)^2}$
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & F^{\prime} \propto \frac{1}{(2 R)^2} \\
    & F^{\prime} \propto \frac{1}{4(R)^2} \\
    & F^{\prime} \propto \frac{F}{4}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The force of gravitation becomes one-fourth of the original force.

3. A sphere of mass 40 kg is placed at a distance of 0.9 m from a sphere of mass 60 kg . If the two spheres attract each other with a force of 0.02 mg f, find the value of gravitational constant.
Solution: Here, $M_1=40 \mathrm{~kg} ; M_2=60 \mathrm{~kg}, r=0.9 \mathrm{~m}$;
   
   $$
    F=0.02 \mathrm{mgf}=0.02 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{kgf}=0.02 \times 10^{-6} \times 9.8 \mathrm{~N}
   $$

   Now, $F=G \frac{M_1 M_2}{r^2}$ or $G=\frac{F r^2}{M_1 M_2}=\frac{0.02 \times 10^{-6} \times 9.8 \times(0.9)^2}{40 \times 60}=6.62 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{Nm}^2 \mathrm{~kg}^{-2}$

**Relationship between $g$ and $G$** : Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity at a planet (or satellite) of mass M and ras, R. By Newton's law of motion, the force on a body of mass $m$ due to gravity on its surface will be.
$F=$ Mass $\times$ Acceleration due to gravity $=m g$
By Newton's gravitational law, this attractive force is given by $F=\frac{G M m}{R^2}$
On equating both the equations, we get $\frac{G M m}{R^2}=m g$
$\operatorname{Or} g=\frac{G M}{R^2}$
The above equation relates the acceleration due to gravity $(g)$ with the gravitational constant ( $G$ ). Obviously, the nes, of $g$ on a planet (or satellite) depends on the mass and radius of that planet (or satellite).
The value of $g$ is different on different planets and satellites. The value of $g$ on the moon's surface is nearly one-sidh the value of $g$ on the Earth's surface. The S.I. unit of acceleration due to gravity ( $g$ ) can also be written as newtonpes kilogram (or $\mathrm{Nkg}^{-1}$ ) instead of $\mathrm{ms}^{-2}$.

MISCONCEPTION

Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects from the same height on Earth.

FACT: Heavy and light objects fall at the same rate (acceleration due to gravity, $g$, is the same), and $g$ is independent of mass of the body.

### Mass and Weight
The mass of a body varies with its velocity. However, this change is perceptible only when the velocity of body ( s s comparable with the speed of light $c\left(=3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}\right)$, so for a body moving with velocity less than $10^6 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}$, its mas is taken to be constant.
Comparison Between Mass and Weight

| Mass | Weight |
| :--- | :--- |
| (i) It is a measure of the quantity of matter contained <br> in the body at rest. | (i) It is the force with which the Earth attracts the bod. |
| (ii) It is a scalar quantity. | (ii) It is a vector quantity. |
| (iii) Its S.1. unit is kg. | (iii) Its S.I. unit is newton (N). |
| (iv) It is measured by a physical (or beam) balance. | (iv) It is measured by a spring balance calibrated to reed <br> in newton. |
| (v) It is constant for a body and does not change with <br> change in place. | (v) It is not constant for a body but varies from place to <br> place due to a change in the value of $g$. |

**Key point**

The weight of a body is also said to be the force of gravity on that body.


**Relationship between weight and mass**: The weight of a body is the product of its mass and acceleration due to gravity.

Weight $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration due to gravity or $W=m g$
Since the value of $g$ varies from place to place, the weight of a given body also varies from place to place. A body of mass $m \mathrm{~kg}$ will weigh $m \mathrm{kgf}$. The spring balance measures the weight of body directly in newton, and by a physical balance, weight is measured in kgf.

**Gravitational Units of Force**

The gravitational unit of force is kilogram force (kgf) in the S.I. system and gram force (gf) in the C.G.S. system.


| 1 kgf | 1 gf |
| :---: | :---: |
| One kilogram force is the force with which Earth pulls an <br> object of mass 1 kg towards itself. <br> Explanation | One gram force is the force with which Earth pulls an <br> object of mass 1 g towards itself. |
| Explanation: | Explanation: |
| $1 \mathrm{kgf}=$ force due to gravity on a mass of 1 kg | $1 \mathrm{gf}=$ force due to gravity on a mass of 1 g |
| $=1 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass $\times g \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ | $=1 \mathrm{~g}$ mass $\times g \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ |
| $=g$ newton | $=g$ dyne |
| Since average value of $g$ is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$, | Since average value of g is $980 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$. |
| $\therefore 1 \mathrm{kgf}=9.8$ newton (or 9.8 N ) | $\therefore 1 \mathrm{gf}=980$ dyne and $1 \mathrm{kgf}=1000 \mathrm{gf}$ |


### Factors Affecting the Value of $g$

**Variation of $g$ with altitude**: Consider Earth to be a sphere of radius $R$ and mass $M$. The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Earth is
$$
g=\frac{G M}{R^2}
$$


<img src="/pcm_content/class9/physics/cengage-chapter3/images/5.01-1.png" width="40%"/>

Consider a point $P$ at a height $h$ above the surface of the Earth. The acceleration due to gravity at point $P$ is
$$
g^{\prime}=\frac{G M}{(R+h)^2}
$$

Dividing Eq. (ii) by Eq. (i), we have,
$$
\frac{g^{\prime}}{g}=\frac{R^2}{(R+h)^2} \text { (or) } g^{\prime}=\frac{g R^2}{(R+h)^2}
$$

Eq. (iii) gives the expression for the variation of acceleration due to gravity with height $h$. It is clear that $g^{\prime}<g$. Thus, as we go above the surface of Earth, acceleration due to gravity goes on decreasing.
Variation of $g$ with depth: Consider the Earth to be sphere of radius $R$ and mass $M$. The acceleration due to gravity at point $Q$ on the surface of the Earth is $g=\frac{G M}{R^2}$.

**Variation of $g$ with depth**

Consider the Earth to be sphere of radius $R$ and mass $M$. The acceleration due to gravity at point $Q$ on the surface of the Earth is $g=\frac{G M}{R^2}$.

<img src="/pcm_content/class9/physics/cengage-chapter3/images/5.01-2.png" width="40%"/>


If $\rho$ is the density of the Earth, then Mass of the Earth is $M=\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho$
$\therefore g=\frac{G\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \rho\right)}{R^2}$ or $g=\frac{4}{3} \pi R G \rho$
Consider a point $P$ inside the Earth and at a depth $d$ below the surface of the Earth. Its distance from the centre $O$ is $(R-d)$. Let a sphere be drawn with $O$ as centre and radius $(R-d)$. The acceleration due to gravity $(g)$ at point $P$ is only due to the sphere of radius $(R-d)$
$\therefore \quad g^{\prime}=\frac{G M^{\prime}}{(R-d)^2}$
where $M^{\prime}=$ mass of inner solid sphere (shaded portion) $=\frac{4}{3} \pi(R-d)^3 \rho$
$$
\therefore \quad g^{\prime}=\frac{G\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi(R-d)^3\right) \rho}{(R-d)^2} \text { (or) } g^{\prime}=\frac{4}{3} \pi(R-d) G \rho
$$

Dividing Eq. (ii) by Eq. (i), we have
$$
\frac{g^{\prime}}{g}=\frac{(R-d)}{R}
$$
or $g^{\prime}=g\left(1-\frac{d}{R}\right)$

Eq. (iii) gives the expression for variation of $g$ with depth $d$.
It is clear that $g^{\prime}<g$. Therefore, as we go below the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity gos $n$ decreasing. At the centre of Earth $(d=R)$, it becomes zero.
$$
g^{\prime}=g\left(1-\frac{d}{R}\right)=g\left(1-\frac{R}{R}\right)=0
$$

Therefore, acceleration due to gravity is zero at the centre of Earth.
Thus, the value of acceleration due to gravity is maximum at the surface of the Earth and becomes zero at the centre of the Earth. That is why the weight $(=\mathrm{mg}$ ) of a body at the centre of the Earth is zero though its mass is constant lifit mean value of $g$ on the Earth surface is taken to be $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$. At altitudes above the Earth's surface or at depth belor the Earth surface, the value of $g$ decreases.


**Variation of $g$ with the shape of the Earth**: The Earth is not a perfect square but is ellipsoidal. It is flattenec at the poles and is bulging at the equator. The polar radius is less than the equatorial radius by about 21 km Therefore, $g$ increases from the equator to the poles. The value of $g$ is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator.

**Variation of $g$ with the rotation of the Earth**: The Earth rotates about an axis that passes through the poles. Therefore bodies on Earth are not in equilibrium because they experience centripetal acceleration as they rotate with Earth. The expression for $g$ due to the rotation of the earth is $g=g_0-R \omega^2 \cos ^2 \lambda$ where $\lambda$ is the angle of rotation and $g_0$ is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface.
At the poles, $\lambda=90^{\circ}$, and therefore, there is no effect of rotation on the value of $g$.
If the Earth were a non-rotating perfect sphere, the value of acceleration due to gravity would have been $g_0$ everywhere.


**Some Important Points About $g$**

1. Galileo was the first scientist to study the motion of different bodies under the force of attraction of Earth (i.e., gravity). From his experiments, Galileo found that if bodies of different masses and sizes (or shapes) are simultaneously made to fall in a vacuum (i.e, in the absence of air) from the same height, they all reach the Earth's surface simultaneously. Thus, all bodies travel the same distance in the same time interval.
2. Free fall: The motion of a freely falling body from a height or the motion of a body thrown vertically upward from the surface of Earth is one-dimensional motion Under gravity. The acceleration of a vertically falling body is $a=g$ and that a body going vertically up is $a=-g$
3. If a body at rest falls freely under the influence of gravity only from a height $h$, then $u=0$ and acceleration is replaced by $g$ (acceleration due to gravity), then:

(i) $v=g t$  
(ii) $h=\frac{1}{2} g t^2$  
(iii) $v^2=2 g h$

But if the body has some initial velocity $u$, then  
(i) $v=u+g t$  
(ii) $h=u t+\frac{1}{2} g t^2$  
(iii) $v^2=u^2+2 g h$  

If a body is thrown vertically up with an initial velocity $u$ to a height $h$, there will be retardation $(a=-g)$, then  
(i) $v=u-g t$  
(ii) $h=u t-\frac{1}{2} g t^2$  
(iii) $v^2=u^2-2 g h$

At the highest point of reach, final velocity $v=0$. Thus, maximum height reached is $h_{\max }=\frac{u^2}{2 g}$ (from equation $v^2=u^2-2 g h$ ) and the time taken by the body to rise to the highest point is $t=\frac{u}{g}$ (from equations $v=u-g t$ ). The same time it takes to come back to the initial point after reaching the highest point. So the total time of journey is $t^{\prime}=2 t=\frac{2 u}{g}$ and the total distance travelled by the body is $h^{\prime}=2 h_{\max }=\frac{u^2}{g}$.

EXAMPLES  
1. At a certain height above the Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is $4 \%$ of its value at the surface of Earth. Determine the height.  
Solution: Given: $g_h=4 \%$ of $g \Rightarrow g_h=\frac{4}{100} g$ and radius of the Earth $\left(R_E\right)=6400 \mathrm{~km}$
We know $g_h=\frac{g}{\left(1+\frac{h}{R_E}\right)^2}$    

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{4}{100} g=\frac{g}{\left(1+\frac{h}{R_E}\right)^2} \\
& \left(1+\frac{h}{R_E}\right)^2=25
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 1+\frac{h}{R_E}=5 \\
& \frac{h}{R_E}=4 \\
& h=4 R_E=4(6400)=25600 \mathrm{~km}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Assuming the Earth to be a sphere of uniform mass density, how much would a body weigh half-way downtos center of the Earth if it weighed 250 N on the surface?  

   Solution: Weight on the Earth's surface, $m g=250 \mathrm{~N}$
   As $g_d=g\left(1-\frac{d}{R}\right)$ and $d=\frac{R}{2}$
   $$
   g_d=g\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{g}{2}
   $$

   Thus, weight half-way down the center of the Earth $=m g_d=\frac{m g}{2}=\frac{250}{2}=125 \mathrm{~N}$

3. If $g_0$ is acceleration due to gravity at a height equal to twice the radius of the Earth, then what would be acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth?  
   Solution: if $g_0$ is acceleration due to gravity on the surface,  
   $g=\frac{G M}{R^2}$ and $g_0=\frac{G M}{(R+h)^2}$  
   Since $h=2 R$, then $g_0=\frac{G M}{(R+2 R)^2}=\frac{G M}{9 R^2}=\frac{g}{9}$  
   $
   g=9 g_0
   $

4. Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is $g$. If the radius of the Earth shrinks to half the preset values such that is mass does not change, then what would be the acceleration due to gravity on the surfoced the Earth?  
Solution: In the first case, $g=\frac{G M}{R^2}$  
In the next case, $g^{\prime}=\frac{G M}{\left(\frac{R}{2}\right)^2}=\frac{4 G M}{R^2}=4 g$  

5. Find the depth from the surface of the Earth at which the acceleration due to gravity will be $75 \%$ of the value at the surface of the Earth. (Radius of the Earth $=R$ )  
Solution: At depth $d$ from the surface of the Earth, $g^{\prime}=g\left(1-\frac{d}{R}\right)$
Given: $g^{\prime}=\frac{75}{100} g$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& g^{\prime}=\frac{3 g}{4} \\
& \frac{3 g}{4}=g\left(1-\frac{d}{R}\right) \\
& d=\frac{R}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$
