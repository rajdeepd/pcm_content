FORMULAS AND CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE

1. Universal Law of Gravitation
   
   Every particle in the universe attracts every other particle in the universe with a force, which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
   or, $\quad \mathrm{F}=\frac{\mathrm{GM}_1 \mathrm{M}_2}{\mathrm{r}^2}$
   Where $M_1, M_2$ are masses of particles, $r$ is distance between particles and $G$ is a constant known as the universal constant of gravitation. The value of $G$ was experimentally measured in the laboratory. This value is $\mathrm{G}=6.67 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{Nm}^2 / \mathrm{kg}^2$.

   ' $G$ ' is same everywhere and between any two bodies interacting gravitationally.    
2. The force with which earth attracts any other body towards its centre is called force of gravity and the acceleration produced by force of gravity is called acceleration due to gravity.
   
3. Variation in the Acceleration Due to Gravity:  
(a) Inside the earth: $g=g_0 \frac{x}{R_c}$ ( $x$ is distance from the centre of the earth)
(b) Outside the earth $g=g_0\left(\frac{R_c}{x}\right)^2$
4. Kepler's law of Planetary Motion:  
(i). The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the sun at one of its focii.   
(ii). The line joining the planet and the sun sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time.  
(Areal velocity is constant).  
(iii). The cube of mean distance of a planet from sun is proportional to square of its orbital time period T. i.e. $T^2 \propto r^3$  

Motion of Planets and Satellites in Circular Orbits
$$
F=\frac{\mathrm{GMm}}{\mathrm{r}^2}=\mathrm{m}\left(\frac{\mathrm{v}^2}{\mathrm{r}}\right)
$$

Speed of Satellite, $v=\sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}$  
Time period of revolution; $\mathrm{T}=\frac{2 \pi \mathrm{r}}{\mathrm{v}}=\frac{2 \pi \mathrm{r}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{GM}_0 / \mathrm{r}}}=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{\mathrm{GM}_0}} \mathrm{r}^{3 / 2}$
