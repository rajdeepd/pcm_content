# Section B
**Problem 1:** <br/>
A box of mass $20 \mathrm{~kg}$ is pushed along a rough foor with a valocity $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and then let go . The box moves $5 \mathrm{~m}$ on the floor before coming to rest. What must be the frictional force acting on the box?
$$
\begin{aligned}
& m=20 \mathrm{~kg}, u=2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v=0, s=5 \mathrm{~m} \\
& v^2=u^2+2 a s \\
& 0=(2)^2+2 a \times 5 \\
& a=-\frac{4}{10} \\
& F=m a \\
& F=20\left(\frac{-4}{10}\right) \\
& F=-8 \mathrm{~N}
\end{aligned}
$$

Magnitude of friction force is $8 \mathrm{~N}$.

**Problem 2:** <br/>
A targe truck and a car are moving with same velocity have a hoad on collision. Then which of them exert more force on the other?

Solution: Both will exert same force, when two bodies collide then the force of interadion between them makes action - reaction pair.
And, force of action $=$ force of reaction.

**Problem 3:** <br/>
A bomb of mass $9 \mathrm{~kg}$ initially at rest explodes into two pieces of masses $3 \mathrm{~kg}$ and Eha the hinetic enorgy of $3 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass is $216 \mathrm{~J}$, then what is the velocity of $6 \mathrm{~kg}$ moss?

Solution: $\quad$ For $3 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{2} m v^2=216 \\
& V=12 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using linear mornentum conservation for the system
$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_i=P_f \\
& m(0)=(3)(12)+6(v) \\
& v=6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{scc} .
\end{aligned}
$$

**Problem 4:** <br/>
A man of 80 kg mass stands on a welghting machine in a liff which is moving upwards with a uniform speed of $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. What is the reading of the weighing machine? (Take $g=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ )

Solution. As the lift is moving with uniform speed so woighting machine will read true weight $W=m g=(80)(10)=800 N$


**Problem 5<br/>**
A horizontal jet of water is made to hit a vertical wall with a negiligible rebound If the speed of water from the jet is ' $v$ ', the diameter of the jet is ' $d$ ' and the density of wate ' $\rho$ ', then what is the force exerted on the wall by the jet of water?

Solution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Force exerted }=\frac{\text { Change in momentum }}{\text { time }} \\
& =\frac{P_f-P_i}{t} \\
& P_f=m v=\rho \times \pi\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 \times v t \times v \\
& P_i=0 \\
& \text { Force exerted }=\frac{\rho \pi \frac{d^2}{4} v^2 t}{1}=\rho \pi \frac{d^2}{4} v^2 .
\end{aligned}
$$
