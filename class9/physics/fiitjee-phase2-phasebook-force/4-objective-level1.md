## Level - III

### Multiple choice questions (single option correct)

**Problem 1:** A body begins to slide over the surface of another when pulled with a force of $10 \mathrm{~N}$ pull with a force of $5 \mathrm{~N}$, the force of friction that will come into play is: <br/>
(A) Zero <br/>
(B) $0.5 \mathrm{~N}$ <br/>
(C) $5 \mathrm{~N}$ <br/>
(D) $50 \mathrm{~N}$ <br/>

Solution: (C)
Limiting friction is $10 \mathrm{~N}$. When the force applied is $5 \mathrm{~N}$, the frictional force will also be $5 \mathrm{~N}$ because the body will not be moving.

Coefficient of friction, ratio of the frictional force resisting the motion of two surfaces in contact to the normal force pressing the two surfaces together. It is usually symbolized by the Greek letter mu (μ). Mathematically, μ = F/N, where F is the frictional force and N is the normal force. Because both F and N are measured in units of force (such as newtons or pounds), the coefficient of friction is dimensionless. The coefficient of friction has different values for static friction and kinetic friction. In static friction, the frictional force resists force that is applied to an object, and the object remains at rest until the force of static friction is overcome. In kinetic friction, the frictional force resists the motion of an object. For the case of a brick sliding on a clean wooden table, the coefficient of kinetic friction is about 0.5, which implies that a force equal to half the weight of the bricks is required just to overcome friction in keeping the bricks moving along at a constant speed, and the coefficient of static friction is about 0.6. The frictional force itself is directed oppositely to the motion of the object.

**Problem 2:** The coefficient of friction of an inclined plane is $1 / \sqrt{3}$. If it is inclined at angle $30^{\circ}$ with horizontal, what will be the downward acceleration of the block placed on the inclined plane ? <br/>
(A) 0 <br/>
(B) $\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ <br/>
(C) $\sqrt{3} \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ <br/>
(C) $3 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ 

<img src="//pcm_content/class9/physics/images/leve3-problem2.png" width="15%"/>

Solution: (A)
$$
\begin{aligned}
a & =g(\sin \theta-\mu \cos \theta) \\
& =g\left(\sin 30^{\circ}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \cos 30^{\circ}\right) \\
& =g\left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right]=0 .
\end{aligned}
$$

Another way of explaining

Let a be the downward acceleration of block. From FBD,
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{ma}=\mathrm{mg} \sin \theta-\mathrm{f}=\mathrm{mg} \sin \theta-\mu \mathrm{mg} \cos \theta \\
& \text { or } \mathrm{a}=\mathrm{g} \sin 30-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \mathrm{~g} \cos 30=\frac{\mathrm{g}}{2}-\mathrm{g}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \\
& \therefore \mathrm{a}=\mathrm{o}
\end{aligned}
$$
