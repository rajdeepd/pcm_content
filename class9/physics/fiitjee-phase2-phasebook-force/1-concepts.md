# Force and Laws of Motion

## FORCE

Force is external effort in the form of push or pull, which  
(1) produces or tries to produce motion in a body at rest, or   
(ii) stops or tries to stop a moving body or   
(iii) changes or tres to change the direction of motion of the body, or    
(Iv) changes or tries to change the shape of a body.

The following examples illustrate the above definition:   
(i) When we push a heavy stone, it does not move. The effort made in this case has only tried to produce motion.   
(ii) A ball falling downwards can be easily caught by our hands. The motion of the ball has been stopped.

**Resultant Force:**
If single force acting on a body produces the same acceleration as produced by a number of forces, that single force is called the resultant of these individual forces.

**Balanced and Unbalanced Forces:**
If a set of forces acting on a body produces no acceleration in it, the forces are said to be balanced. If it produces a nonzero acceleration, the forces are said to be unbalanced.

## INERTIA

It is inherent property of all bodies, by virtue of which it resists or opposes any change to its present state (of rest or of uniform motion). It varies directly as mass of the body.

Inertia of a Body is of Three Types

(a) Inertla of rest   
It is inability of a body to change by itself, its state of rest. This means a body at rest remains at rest and cannot start moving on its own.
e g. A person who is standing freely in a bus, thrown backward when bus starts suddenly.

(b) Inertia of motion   
It is inabillty of a body to change by itself its state of uniform motion l.c. a body in uniform motion can neither accelerate nor retard on its own and come to rest.
e.g. A person jumping out of a moving bus may fall forward.

(c) Inertia of Direction   
It is inability of a body to change by itself its direction of motion.
e.g. When a car goes round a curve suddenly, the person sitting inside is thrown outwards.

</p>

## NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION

According to this law, a body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force to change the state. So we can say, mithout the application of an external force, body will not change any type of its inertia either the inertia of rest, inertia, of motion or inertia of direction.

(i). Choose the right answer: <br/>

$A$ and $B$ are two objects with masses $8 \mathrm{~kg}$ and $20 \mathrm{~kg}$ respectlvely, then:<br/>
&nbsp; (A) $A$ has more inertla than $ B $<br/>
&nbsp; (B) $B$ has more inertia than $A$<br/>
&nbsp; (C) $A$ and $B$ have the same inertla<br/>
&nbsp; (D) none of the two has inertia<br/>
(ii). Explain why, is it dangorous to jump out of a moving bus?<br/>
(iii). On what factor does the inertia of a body depends. Which has more inertia, a cricket ball or a rubber ball of the samo size?<br/>
</p>

<hr>

## MOMENTUM

Suppose we throw a cricket ball and a tennis ball, both with the same speed or velocity. It will be founc that more force is required to stop the cricket ball which has more mass and less force is required to stof the tennis ball (which has less mass). And if we throw two cricket ball of same mass but with differen speed or velocity. It will be found that more force is required to stop the ball having more velocity a: compared to the ball with less velocity. We conclude that there must be a physical quantity which depends on the mass of the body as well as on velocity of the body. That physical quantity is known a: "momentum". Thus, momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. **Momentu** is a is a measure of the quantity of motion of a body.

Thus, momentum $=$ mass $\times$ velocity
$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=\mathrm{m} \overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}}
$$

Where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=$ momentum
$m=$ mass of the body
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=$ velocity of the body.

Momentum is a vector quantity, and its direction is same as the direction of velocity. Its SI unit is kilogram - meter per second or $\mathrm{kg}$ - $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$.
<hr>
Exercise 3:<br/>

(1) Name the physical quantily whose unit is $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$.<br>
(2). A body of mass $25 \mathrm{~kg}$ has a momentum of $25 \mathrm{~kg}$ $\mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate the velocity of the body?
<hr>

## NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION

states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the same direction as the force.
Suppose the velocity of a body of mass $m$ changes from $u$ to $v$ in time $L$. The magnitudes of initial and nal momentum of the body will be $P_1=\mathrm{mu}$ and $\mathrm{P}_2=\mathrm{mv}$ respectively. The change in momentum $\left.P_2-P_1\right)_1$ takes place in time $t$. Then according to law

or $F \propto \frac{P_2-P_1}{t}$    
or $\quad F=k \frac{m(v-u)}{t}$   &nbsp; ... (i)   
$F=k m a$ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... (ii)   

We choose the units of force in such a manner that the value of $k=1$. So that   
$F=m a$  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ... (iii)

### Another Form of Second Law
The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the product of the "mass" of the body and the acceleration produced in the body by the action of the force, and it acts in the direction of the acceleration.
Force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration
or $F=k \mathrm{ma}$, where $k$ is a constant

The value of $k$ in $S I$. unit is 1 .
So the above equation becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=\text { ma } \\
& \text { Force }=\text { mass } \times \text { acceleration }
\end{aligned}
$$

So from the above equation, the acceleration produced on the body is given by
$$
\mathrm{a}=\frac{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{m}}
$$

The SI. unit of force is Newton which is denoted by N. One Newton is that force which when acting on a body of mass $1 \mathrm{~kg}$ produces an acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ in it.

**<span>&#9758;</span> Illustration 1**

The same force acts on two masses $A$ and $B$ separately, producing acceleration of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^5$ and $15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ respectively. Find the ratio of their masses.

Solution:
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m_1 a_1=m_2 a_2 \\
& \frac{m_1}{m_2}=\frac{a_2}{a_1}=\frac{15}{20} \text { or } \frac{3}{4} \\
& \therefore \text { Mass of } A \text { : mass of } B=3: 4 \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

A mass of $2 \mathrm{~kg}$ at resit travels for $4 \mathrm{sec}$ with on accoloration of $1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$. What is the gain of momentum?
Solution:
Gain of momentum $=$ final momentum - initial momentum
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Now, } v=u+a t \\
& =0+(1.5 \times 4)=6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& \text { Final momentum }=\mathrm{m} \times v \\
& =2 \times 6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& \text { Initial momentum }=m \times u=2 \times 0=0 \\
& \therefore \text { Gain of momentum }=(12-0) \\
& =12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \text {. }
\end{aligned}
$$

**<span>&#9758;</span> Illustration 3 :**

A constant retarding force of $50 \mathrm{~N}$ is applied to a body of mass $20 \mathrm{~kg}$ moving initially with a speed of $1 \mathrm{~s}$ $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$. How long does the body take to stop?
Solution :
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { We know } F=\frac{m v-m u}{t} \\
& \text { Given } F=-50 \mathrm{~N} \\
& \text { Initial momentum, } m u=20 \times 15=300 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& \text { Final momentum, } m v=20 \times 0=0 \\
& \text { Time, } t=\text { ? } \\
& \text { Putring the values in (i) equation } \\
& \Rightarrow-50=\frac{0-300}{t} \\
& \Rightarrow t=6 \text { second }
\end{aligned}
$$

Putting the values in (i) equation

**<span>&#9758;</span> Illustration 4 :**

A force of 0.04 Newton acts upon a body as a result, the speed of the body changes from $0.30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ to $0.10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$, in passing through a certain distance. Find the distance if the mass of the body is one kilogram?<br/>
Solution:
Since velocity is decreasing. So the force is retarding
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=-0.04 \mathrm{~N}, \\
& m=1 \mathrm{~kg}, \\
& v=0.10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& u=0.30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

From the formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m a \\
& \Rightarrow-0.04=1 \times a \\
& \Rightarrow a=-0.04 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2
\end{aligned}
$$
and from the formula $v^2=u^2+2$ as
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow(0.1)^2=(30)^2-2 \times .04 \times s \\
& \Rightarrow \mathrm{s}=1 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$$

The speed time graph of a car is given below.

<!--<img src="/class9/physics/images/physics-9-fitjee-force-figure1.png" />-->

The car weighs $1000 \mathrm{~kg}$.

(i) What is the distance travelled by the car in the first two seconds?
(iii) What is the braking force applied at the end of 5 seconds to bring the car to a stop within one second?

Solution:
(i) Distance travelled in firsl two seconds
$=$ Area under the line OA and the time axis
$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{1}{2} \times \text { Base } \times \text { height } \\
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 15=15 \text { moters }
\end{aligned}
$$
(ii) For, braking force
$$
F=m a
$$

Acceleration in last one second $=$ slope of line $\mathrm{BC}=\frac{0-15}{6-5}=-\frac{15}{1}$
a $=-15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
Negative acceleration indicates retardation
So required retarding force, $\mathrm{f}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=m a=1000 \times(-15) \\
& F=-15000 N
\end{aligned}
$$

### NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

According to this law, "to every action, there is always an equal and opposito roaction le. the forces of action and reaction are always equal and opposito. Here, the term action means the force exerted by the first body on second body while the term reaction means the force exerted by the second body on the first i.e. $\vec{F}_{12}=-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}}_{21}$ We can understand this law with the following illustration.

(a) When a gun is fired, the bullet moves forward (action). The gun recoils backwards (reaction)<br/>
(b) When a rubber ball is struck against a wall or noor, it exurts a force on wall (action). The ball rebounds due to equal force (reaction) exerted by the wall<br/>
(c) While walking, a person pressos the ground in the backward direction (action) by his feet The ground pushes the person in forward direction with an equal force (reaction). The component of reaction in the horizontal direction makes the person moves fonward.

<hr>

(i). Why does a runner press the ground with his feet before ho starts his run.<br/>
(ii). Do action and reaction act on the same body or different bodies? How are they related in magnifude and direction?<br/>
(iii) The two ends of a spring-balance are pulled each by a force of $10 \mathrm{~kg}$ we What will be the reading of the balance?<br/>
(iv) Action and reaction forces do not balance each other. Why ?<br/>
(v). Explain, why it is difficult for a fireman to hold a hose, which ejects large amounts of water at a high  velocity?
<hr>

### THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

To understand the law of conservation of momentum, let's take a case study. Consider the two balls and 8 having masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. Let the initial velocity of ball $A$ be $u_1$ and that of ball be $\mathrm{u}_2$.

<img src="class9/physics/images/before-collision.png" width="60%"/>
<img src="class9/physics/images/after-collision.png" width="60%"/>


Suppose the two balls collide with each other head on and their collision last for $t$ seconds. Suppose the velocities of ball $A$ and $B$ become $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively after the collision.

The momenturn of ball $A$ before and after the collision is $m_1 u_1$ and $m_1 v_1$ respectively The rate change of its momentum during the coll momentum of ball $B$ will be $\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}$.
So according to Newton's second law.
$$
F_{12}=\frac{m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)}{t} \text { and } F_{21}=\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}
$$


Now according to the third law of motion, the forces $F_{12}$ exerted by ball $B$ on ball $A$ and the force $F_{21}$ exerted by the ball $A$ on the ball $B$ should be equal and opposite to each other
Therefore  
$$\mathrm{F}_{12}=-\mathrm{F}_{21}$$
So we get 
$$\frac{m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)}{t}=-\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}$$
or 
$$m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)=-m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)$$
$$
\Rightarrow \quad m_1 u_1+m_2 u_2=m_1 v_1+m_2 v_2
$$

Total initial Momentum $=$ Total final Mornentum
So from the above result, we can define the law of conservation of momentum, when there is no external force acting on a system, the total momentum of the system remains conserved.



**<span>&#9758;</span> Illustration 7 :**

A nfle of mass $3 \mathrm{~kg}$ fires a bulfet of mass $0.03 \mathrm{~kg}$. The bullet leaves the barrel of the nfle at a velocity of $100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. If the bullet takes $0.003 \mathrm{sec}$ to move through its barred. Calculate the force expenenced by the rifle due to its recoil.

Solution :
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { We have } m_1=3 \mathrm{~kg}, m_2=0.03 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& u_1=u_2=0, \quad v_1=? \quad v_2=100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to the law of conservation of momentum.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_1 u_1+m_2 u_2=m_1 v_1+m_2 v_2 \\
& \Rightarrow 0+0=3 v_1+100 \times 0.03 \\
& \Rightarrow v_1=-1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to second laws of Newton
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=\frac{m(v-u)}{t} \\
& F=\frac{3(-1-0)}{0.003}=-\frac{3}{003} \\
& F=-1000 N
\end{aligned}
$$

**<span>&#9758;</span>  Illustration 8 :**

A $6 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass A moving with a velocity of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ collides with a $4 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass $B$ moving with a velocity of 1.5 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the opposite direction in a straight line. If the two masses get stuck, what is the velocity of the combination?

![alt text](image.png)


Solution:

Bofore collision.
Mamentum of $A=m, u_1$
$=6 \times 2 \approx 12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction $A C$, say
Momentum of $\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{m}_2 \mathrm{U}_2$
$=4 \times 1.5$ or $6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction $B D$
Total momentum $=12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
After collision
Mass of combination $=6+4=10 \mathrm{~kg}$

Let velocity of combination be $\mathrm{v} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$
By the law of conservation of momentum the sum of the initial momentum = for momentum.

So we have,
$$
6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=10 \times v \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$
or $v=0.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

Since the value is positive, the direction of velocity is AC
The velocity of the combination $=0.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.


** <span>&#9758;</span>  Illustration 9 : **

A girf of mass $40 \mathrm{~kg}$ jumps with a horizontal velocity of $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ on to a stationary cart with friction less wheels. The mass of the cart is $3 \mathrm{~kg}$. What is her volocity as the cart starts moving? Assume that the is no extornal unbalanced force working in tho horizontal direction.


Solution:

Let $v$ be the velocity of the girl on the cart as the cart starts moving. The tol momenta of the girl and cart before the interaction.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& =40 \mathrm{~kg} \times 5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times 0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =200 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Total momenta after the interaction
$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(40+3) \mathrm{kg} \times \vee \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =43 \vee \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s} /
\end{aligned}
$$

According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum is conserve during the interaction.
That is,
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 43 v=200 \\
& \Rightarrow v=200 / 43=+4.65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The girl on cart would movo with a velccity of $4.65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction in which the girl jumped.
