## KEY TO EXERCISES

Exercise 1: <br>
(i). Rest <br>
(ii). Direction <br>
(wi). Direction <br>

Exercise 2 : <br>
(i). $\mathrm{B}$ <br>
(ii) Due to inertia of motion one falls forward <br>
(iii) Mass, Cricket ball <br>

Exercise 3 : <br>
(i). Momenturn, impulse <br>
(ii). $\quad v=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ <br>

Exercise 4. <br>
(i). To recerve less impulse by ball by increasing time. <br>
(ii). More the speed, higher the momenturn and larger the energy (KE) is associated with process. <br>

Exercise 5: <br>
(i). To get reaction by the ground. <br>
(ii). Different bodies, equal and opposite <br>
(iii). The reading of the balance will be $10 \mathrm{~kg} . \mathrm{wt}$ <br>
(iv). This is because forces of a action and reaction act always on two different bodies. <br>
(v). Due to reaction of water on hose. <br>
