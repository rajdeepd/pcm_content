### NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

According to this law, "to every action, there is always an equal and opposito roaction le. the forces of action and reaction are always equal and opposito. Here, the term action means the force exerted by the first body on second body while the term reaction means the force exerted by the second body on the first i.e. $\vec{F}_{12}=-\overrightarrow{\mathrm{F}}_{21}$ We can understand this law with the following illustration.

(a) When a gun is fired, the bullet moves forward (action). The gun recoils backwards (reaction)<br/>
(b) When a rubber ball is struck against a wall or noor, it exurts a force on wall (action). The ball rebounds due to equal force (reaction) exerted by the wall<br/>
(c) While walking, a person pressos the ground in the backward direction (action) by his feet The ground pushes the person in forward direction with an equal force (reaction). The component of reaction in the horizontal direction makes the person moves fonward.

<hr>
Exercise 5:

(i). Why does a runner press the ground with his feet before ho starts his run.<br/>
(ii). Do action and reaction act on the same body or different bodies? How are they related in magnifude and direction?<br/>
(iii) The two ends of a spring-balance are pulled each by a force of $10 \mathrm{~kg}$ we What will be the reading of the balance?<br/>
(iv) Action and reaction forces do not balance each other. Why ?<br/>
(v). Explain, why it is difficult for a fireman to hold a hose, which ejects large amounts of water at a high  velocity?

### THE LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

To understand the law of conservation of momentum, let's take a case study. Consider the two balls and 8 having masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. Let the initial velocity of ball $A$ be $u_1$ and that of ball be $\mathrm{u}_2$.

<img src="class9/physics/images/before-collision.png" width="60%"/>
<img src="class9/physics/images/after-collision.png" width="60%"/>


Suppose the two balls collide with each other head on and their collision last for $t$ seconds. Suppose the velocities of ball $A$ and $B$ become $v_1$ and $v_2$ respectively after the collision.

The momenturn of ball $A$ before and after the collision is $m_1 u_1$ and $m_1 v_1$ respectively The rate change of its momentum during the coll momentum of ball $B$ will be $\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}$.
So according to Newton's second law.
$$
F_{12}=\frac{m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)}{t} \text { and } F_{21}=\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}
$$


Now according to the third law of motion, the forces $F_{12}$ exerted by ball $B$ on ball $A$ and the force $F_{21}$ exerted by the ball $A$ on the ball $B$ should be equal and opposite to each other
Therefore  
$$\mathrm{F}_{12}=-\mathrm{F}_{21}$$
So we get 
$$\frac{m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)}{t}=-\frac{m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)}{t}$$
or 
$$m_1\left(v_1-u_1\right)=-m_2\left(v_2-u_2\right)$$
$$
\Rightarrow \quad m_1 u_1+m_2 u_2=m_1 v_1+m_2 v_2
$$

Total initial Momentum $=$ Total final Mornentum
So from the above result, we can define the law of conservation of momentum, when there is no external force acting on a system, the total momentum of the system remains conserved.

A nfle of mass $3 \mathrm{~kg}$ fires a bulfet of mass $0.03 \mathrm{~kg}$. The bullet leaves the barrel of the nfle at a velocity of $100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. If the bullet takes $0.003 \mathrm{sec}$ to move through its barred. Calculate the force expenenced by the rifle due to its recoil.

Solution :
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { We have } m_1=3 \mathrm{~kg}, m_2=0.03 \mathrm{~kg} \\
& u_1=u_2=0, \quad v_1=? \quad v_2=100 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to the law of conservation of momentum.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_1 u_1+m_2 u_2=m_1 v_1+m_2 v_2 \\
& \Rightarrow 0+0=3 v_1+100 \times 0.03 \\
& \Rightarrow v_1=-1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

According to second laws of Newton
$$
\begin{aligned}
& F=\frac{m(v-u)}{t} \\
& F=\frac{3(-1-0)}{0.003}=-\frac{3}{003} \\
& F=-1000 N
\end{aligned}
$$

A $6 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass A moving with a velocity of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ collides with a $4 \mathrm{~kg}$ mass $B$ moving with a velocity of 1.5 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the opposite direction in a straight line. If the two masses get stuck, what is the velocity of the combination?

![alt text](image.png)


Solution:

Bofore collision.
Mamentum of $A=m, u_1$
$=6 \times 2 \approx 12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction $A C$, say
Momentum of $\mathrm{B}=\mathrm{m}_2 \mathrm{U}_2$
$=4 \times 1.5$ or $6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction $B D$
Total momentum $=12 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}-6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
After collision
Mass of combination $=6+4=10 \mathrm{~kg}$

Let velocity of combination be $\mathrm{v} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$
By the law of conservation of momentum the sum of the initial momentum = for momentum.

So we have,
$$
6 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}=10 \times v \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
$$
or $v=0.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$

Since the value is positive, the direction of velocity is AC
The velocity of the combination $=0.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.


** <span>&#9758;</span>  Illustration 9 : **

A girf of mass $40 \mathrm{~kg}$ jumps with a horizontal velocity of $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ on to a stationary cart with friction less wheels. The mass of the cart is $3 \mathrm{~kg}$. What is her volocity as the cart starts moving? Assume that the is no extornal unbalanced force working in tho horizontal direction.


Solution:

Let $v$ be the velocity of the girl on the cart as the cart starts moving. The tol momenta of the girl and cart before the interaction.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& =40 \mathrm{~kg} \times 5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}+3 \mathrm{~kg} \times 0 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =200 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$$

Total momenta after the interaction
$$
\begin{aligned}
& =(40+3) \mathrm{kg} \times \vee \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s} \\
& =43 \vee \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s} /
\end{aligned}
$$

According to the law of conservation of momentum, the total momentum is conserve during the interaction.
That is,
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 43 v=200 \\
& \Rightarrow v=200 / 43=+4.65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The girl on cart would movo with a velccity of $4.65 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ in the direction in which the girl jumped.
