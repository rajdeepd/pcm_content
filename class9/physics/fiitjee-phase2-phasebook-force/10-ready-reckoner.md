# Phasebook
## FORCE

Force is external effort in the form of push or pull, which  
(1) produces or tries to produce motion in a body at rest, or   
(ii) stops or tries to stop a moving body or   
(iii) changes or tres to change the direction of motion of the body, or    
(Iv) changes or tries to change the shape of a body.

## INERTIA

It is inherent property of all bodies, by virtue of which it resists or opposes any change to its present state (of rest or of uniform motion). It varies directly as mass of the body.

Inertia of a Body is of Three Types

(a) Inertla of rest   

(b) Inertia of motion   

(c) Inertia of Direction   

## NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION

According to this law, a body continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless it is acted upon by some external force to change the state. 

### Momentum

Momentum of a body is defined as the product of its mass and velocity. **Momentu** is a is a measure of the quantity of motion of a body.

Thus, momentum $=$ mass $\times$ velocity
$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=\mathrm{m} \overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}}
$$

Where $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{P}}=$ momentum
$m=$ mass of the body
$\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}=$ velocity of the body.

## NEWTON'S SECOND LAW OF MOTION

states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the same direction as the force.

or $F \propto \frac{P_2-P_1}{t}$    
or $\quad F=k \frac{m(v-u)}{t}$   &nbsp; ... (i)   
$F=k m a$ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ... (ii)   

We choose the units of force in such a manner that the value of $k=1$. So that   
$F=m a$  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ... (iii)

### Another form of the Second Law

The force acting on a body is directly proportional to the product of the "mass" of the body and the acceleration produced in the body by the action of the force, and it acts in the direction of the acceleration.  
Force $=$ mass $\times$ acceleration  
or $F=k \mathrm{ma}$, where $k$ is a constant

$
\begin{aligned}
& F=\text { ma } \\
& \text { Force }=\text { mass } \times \text { acceleration }
\end{aligned}
$

### NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

According to this law, "to every action, there is always an equal and opposito roaction le. the forces of action and reaction are always equal and opposito. 

The term action means the force exerted by the first body on second body while the term reaction means the force exerted by the second body on the first i.e. 


$$
\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{12}
= -\overrightarrow{\mathbf{F}}_{12}
$$
