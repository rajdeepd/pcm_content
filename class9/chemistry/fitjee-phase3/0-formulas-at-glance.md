**Concentration of a Solution**
Concentration of solution may be expressed in terms of percent by mass of solute which represents the mass of solute per 100 mass units of solution.

$$
\% \text { solute }=\frac{\text { mass of } \text { solute }}{\text { mass of solution }} \times 100
$$


For example, a solution is $10 \%$ sucrose $\left(\mathrm{C}_{11} \mathrm{H}_{22} \mathrm{O}_{11}\right)$ by mass, contains 10 gm of sucrose in 100 gm of solution.

**Molarity**
Molarity includes number of moles of solute dissolved in 1 litre of solution and denoted by ${ }^{\prime} \mathbf{M}$.

$$
M=\frac{n}{V} \times 1000
$$

where $\mathbf{n}=$ number of moles, $\mathbf{V}=\mathrm{ml}$ of solution
Molality
It is the number of moles of solute in 1 Kg of solvent and denoted by ' m '.

$$
m=\frac{n \times 1000}{g m \text { of solvent }}
$$


**Mole Fraction**
It is the ratio of number of moles of one constituent to the total number of moles present in solution.
Mole of fraction of $A=\frac{n_A}{n_A+n_B}$
$n_A=$ number of moles of $A, n_B=$ number of moles of $B$
