## Solutions

1. To answer this question we will assume that the solvent is water. The mass of the solvent will be 2.50 kg .

    NOTE: The density of water is $1 \mathrm{~g}=1 \mathrm{~mL}$

    $$
    \frac{2.50 L}{1} \times \frac{1000 \mathrm{~mL}}{1 L} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~g}}{1 \mathrm{~mL}} \times \frac{1 \mathrm{~kg}}{1000 \mathrm{~g}}=2.50 \mathrm{~kg}
    $$


    To calculate the molality we use the relationship-

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \frac{\text { molsolute }}{\text { kgsolvent }}=\text { molality } \\
    & \frac{0.75 \mathrm{molsolute}}{2.50 \mathrm{kgsolvent}}=0.30 \mathrm{~m}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

2. Dilute is qualitative measure, asnwer $\fbox {C}$

3. 38% HCl means 38 grams HCl in 100grams solution  
    Mass of HCl = 38g  
    Mass of water = 100-38 = 62g=0.062Kg  
    Moles of HCl = mass/molar mass = 38/36.5 = 1.04  
    Volume of solution = mass/density = 100/1.20 = 83.33 ml=0.0833L  
    Now  
    Molality = moles/ mass of solvent in Kg = 1 moles/0.062Kg = 16.12m  
    Molarity = Number of moles/volume of solution in Litre  
    = 1 moles/ 0.0833 Litre=12M  

4. Answer $\fbox {A}$


5. Answer: 0.2

6. 3 molal solution means 3 moles of solute in 1000 gm of solvent.
Mass of 3 moles of NaOH = 3 x molar mass of NaOH
= 3 x 40 = 120 g
    Mass of solvent = 1000 gm
    Mass of solution = mass of solute + mass of solvent
    = 120 + 1000
    = 1120 g

    Volume of solution = mass of solution/density of solution
    = 1120/1.110
    = 1009 ml
    = 1.009 L

    Molarity of solution = moles of solute/volume of solution
    = 3/1.009
    = 2.97 M

8. To determine which concentration unit is independent of temperature, we will analyze the different concentration units: molality, molarity, normality, and weight by volume.
    Understanding Molality:
    - Molality $(\mathrm{m})$ is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.
    - Formula:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \text { Molality }(\mathrm{m}) & =\frac{\text { mass of solute }(\mathrm{g})}{\text { molar mass of solute }(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mol})} \\
    & \times \frac{1000}{\text { mass of solvent }(\mathrm{kg})}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    - Since both the mass of solute and the mass of solvent are constants (they do not change with temperature), molality is independent of temperature.
    Understanding Molarity:
    - Molarity $(M)$ is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution.
    - Formula:

    $$
    \text { Molarity }(\mathrm{M})=\frac{\text { number of moles of solute }}{\text { volume of solution (L) }}
    $$

    - The volume of the solution is temperature-dependent because it can expand or contract with temperature changes. Therefore, molarity is dependent on temperature.
    Understanding Normality:
    - Normality $(\mathrm{N})$ is defined as the number of equivalents of solute per liter of solution.
    - Formula:

    $$
    =\frac{\begin{array}{l}
    \text { Normality }(\mathrm{N}) \\
    \text { mass of solute }(\mathrm{g})
    \end{array}}{\text { volume of solution }(\mathrm{L}) \times \text { equivalent weight of solute }(\mathrm{g} / \text { equiv })}
    $$

    - Similar to molarity, the volume of the solution is temperature-dependent, making normality also dependent on temperature.
    1. Understanding Weight by Volume:
    - Weight by volume percentage is defined as the mass of solute in grams per 100 mL of solution.
    - Formula:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    & \text { Weight by Volume }(\backslash \% \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v}) \\
    = & \frac{\text { weight of solute }(\mathrm{g})}{\text { volume of solution }(\mathrm{mL})} \times 100
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    - The volume term in this calculation is also temperature-dependent, which means weight by volume is temperature-dependent as well.
    1. Conclusion:
    - After analyzing all the concentration units, we find that only molality is independent of temperature.

    Final Answer:
    The concentration unit independent of temperature is molality.

9. Correct option is C

    Let Amount of solute $=0.235 \mathrm{~mol} ;$   
    Amount of solvent $=(1-0.235) \mathrm{mol}=0.765 \mathrm{~mol}$ 
    
    Mass of solvent, $m=n M_{\mathrm{m}}=(0.765 \mathrm{~mol}) 154 \mathrm{gmol}^{-1}=117.81 \mathrm{~g}$ 
    
    Molality of solution $=\frac{n}{m}=\frac{0.235 \mathrm{~mol}}{117.81 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kg}}=2.0 \mathrm{molkg}^{-1}$
