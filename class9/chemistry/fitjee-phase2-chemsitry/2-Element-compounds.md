# Elements

An eiement is a substance which cannot be split up into two or more simpler substances.
Nitrogen is an element because it cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical methods. On the other hand, ammonia is not an eiement because it can be split up into two simpler substances, hydrogen and nitrogen.

There are 116 elements known at present, out of which 92 elements occur naturally, while the remaining 23 elements have been prepared artificially. These eiements can be solids, liquids or gases. For example, magnesium and phosphorus elements are solids, mercury and bromine elements are liquids, whereas nitrogen and helium elements are gases, at the room temperature.

Ail these elements sometimes show similar properties with other whereas sometimes behave completely different from other. Hence based on study of these properties and their behaviour, these eiements can be divided into three categories.
1. Metals
2. Non-metals and
3. Metalloids

Metai are generaily maileabie and ductile and conducts electricity. Most of the metais are generally solids except mercury, which is liquid at room temperature. On the other hand, non-metais are those which generally do not posses the above mentioned properties.

### Difference between Metals and Non-metals

| Metals | Non-metals |
| :---: | :---: |
| (i) Metais are malleable. This means that materials can be beaten into thin sheets with a hammer | (i) Non-metals are not maileable. Non-metals are britile. |
| (ii) Melais are ductile. This means that motals can be drawn (or stretched) into thin wires. | (ii) Non-metais are not ductile. |
| (iii) Metals are lustrous (or shiny) and can be polished | (ii) Non-metals are not lustrous (not shiny). They are dull. |
| Metais are good conductors of heat and electricity | (iv) Non-metals are bad conduciors of heat and electrialy. |
| (v) Metais are sonorous. This means that metals can make a ringing, vibrating or resonating sound when we stike them. | (v) Non-metais are not sonorous. |
| Meiais are usually strong. They have high tensile strength. This means that metals can hoid large weights without breaking. | (vi) Non-metais are not strong. They have low tensile strangth. |
| (vi) Metals generaily have high meiting point and boiling point. | (vil) Non-metais have comparatively fow mething point and boiling point. |

There are a few elements which show some properties of metals and other properties of non-matals. For example, they look like metals, but they are britte like non-metals. They are neither conductors of electricity like metals nor insulators like non-metals, they are semiconductor. These elements which show some properties of metals and some other properties of non-metals are called metalloids, also known as semi-metals. Some important examples of metalloids are: Boron (B). Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge).

Give reason why  
(a) copper metal is used for making electrical wires.  
(b) graphite is used for making electrodes in a dry cell.  

**Solution:** (a) It is a good conducior of electricity and is ducble.
(b) it is a good conductor of electricily and having very high melting point.

Exerclse 2 :
(i) Classify the following into metals, non-metals and metalloids: Silicon, Mercury, Dlamond, Sulphur, lodine, Germanium, Sodium, Carbon, Magneslum, Copper, Boron, Hellum
(ii) Name one solld, one llquid and one gasoous non-metal.
(iii) What are the throe groups into which all the elements can be divided? Name two elements belonging to each group.

## Compounds

A compound is a pure substance containing two or more than two eiements chamically bonded together in a fixed proportion by weight and which can be decomposed into its constituent eiements by suitable chemical methods. Further the properties of a compound are completely different from those of its constituent elements.
Carbon dioxide, for example, is a compound containing carbon and oxygen combined together in a fixed proportion of $3: 8$ by weight. It can be decomposed into its constituent eiements i. e carbon and oxygen Further the properties of carbon dioxide are completely different from its constituents, carbon and oxygen. For example, carbon is a combustible substance; oxygen gas is a supporter of combustion whereas carbon dioxide is neither combustible nor a supporter of combustion but extinguishes fire.

### Types of Compounds
All the compounds may be divided into the following two categories:  
(i) Organic compounds  
(ii) Inorganic compounds  

(i) Organic compounds: Compounds containing carbon and a few other elements like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, halogens obtained from animais and plants.  
(II) Inorganic compounds: Compounds containing any two or more elements (out of more than 110 elements known so far) obtained from minerais and rocks.
