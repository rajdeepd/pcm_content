# Concentrations of solutions- Weight

## Questions only

1. What is mass of Nitric acid present in 500 ml of $60 \%(\mathrm{wt}-\mathrm{wt} \%)$ solution? Density of the solution is $1.08 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$.
2. A solution of lodine was prepared by adding 25 g of it in benzene. The weightweight\% of the solution was found to be $5 \%$. What is volume of benzene use to prepare the solution? Given density of benzene $=0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$.

3. What is weight-weight\% of concentrated Hydrochloric acid solution, in which 200 ml of solution contains 84 g of HCl in it, and density of solution is $1.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$ ? Ans $-35 \%$
4. A solution $X$ was prepared by dissolving 50 g of sugar in 150 g of water. Another solution $Y$ was prepared by dissolving 80 g of sugar in 120 g of water. Now 30 g of each $X$ and $Y$ solutions are added together. What is the concentration of the mixture? 
   
5. Density of ethyl alcohol is $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$, and that of water is $1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{ml}$. If 20 ml of ethyl alcohol is added to 80 ml of water, what is the concentration of the resulting solution in wt-wt $\%$, wt-vol $\%$ and vol-vol\% respectively?

6. What is mass of Magnesium nitrate in 5 Kg of the sample of water that has concentration 24ppm?

7. A solution of urea was prepared by dissolving certain mass of it in 20 kg of water. If weight-weight\% of the solution is $30 \%$. What is mass of urea in the solution?

8. A 300 ml solution of glucose of $40 \%$ ( wt -vol\%) concentration if added with 700 ml solution of glucose of $20 \%$ (wt-vol \%) concentration. What will be the concentration of the resulting solution?

9. A sample of polluted air found to containing 75 mg of carbon monoxide in 375 kg of air, what is concentration of CO in ppm ?

10. Calculate volume of methanol in $75 \%$ (vol-vol\%) solution prepared by adding it in 150 ml of ethanol (solvent).
