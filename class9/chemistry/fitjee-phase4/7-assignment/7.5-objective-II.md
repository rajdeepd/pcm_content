### Solution

11. 
12. For an electron in g-subshell, value of $1=4$ and thus value of $n=5$ (as $l=0$ to $\mathrm{n}-1$ )
Therefore maximum number of electrons $=2 \mathrm{n}^2=2 \times 5^2=50$
13. A and C There is a positively charged sphere at the centre of an atom called nucleus. and he empty space around nucleus was termed extra nuclear part.
14. Protium, Detrium and Tritium are similar to hydrogen
    ..
15. Nucleons is made up of protons and neutrons
16. Beta Decay is a type of radioactive decay in which a proton is transformed into a neutron or vice versa inside the nucleus of the radioactive sample. Processes like beta decay and alpha decay allow the nucleus of the radioactive sample to get as close as possible to the optimum neutron/ proton ratio. While doing so, the nucleus emits a beta particle which can either be an electron or positron. Remember that there either a proton can turn into a neutron or a neutron into a proton. Electron and the positron are generated to obey the law of conservation of charge. Beta-decay occurs via weak interaction.
