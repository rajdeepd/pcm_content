## Solutions

2. Let's analyze each type of ray:

    *   **Alpha rays:** Alpha rays consist of alpha particles, which are helium nuclei (2 protons and 2 neutrons). These are definitely particles of matter.
    *   **Beta rays:** Beta rays consist of beta particles, which are high-speed electrons or positrons. Electrons are fundamental particles of matter.
    *   **Cathode rays:** Cathode rays are streams of electrons, which are particles of matter.

    Since all three types of rays consist of particles of matter, the correct answer is:

    **(D) All of these**
