## Level-IV
Multiple Choice Questions (Single Option Correct-Based on Case Study Type)  

At the suggestion of Ernest Rutherford, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden bombarded a thin gold foil by $\alpha$-particles from a polonium source. It was expected that $\alpha$-particles would go right through the foil with hardly any deflection. Although, most of the alpha particles indeed were not deviated by much, a few were scattered through very large angles. Some were even scattered in the backward direction. The only way to explain the results, Rutherford found, was to picture an atom as being composed of a tiny nucleus in which its positive charge and nearly all its mass is concentrated. Scattering of $\alpha$-particles is proportional to target thickness.

Here's a revised version with improved formatting and clarity:

**Problem 1.** Rutherford's α-particle scattering experiment led to the conclusion that:

(A) Mass and energy are related  
(B) Mass and positive charge of an atom are concentrated in the nucleus  
(C) Neutrons are present in the nucleus  
(D) Atoms are electrically neutral  

**Solution:** (B)  The scattering of alpha particles at large angles could only be explained by a concentrated positive charge and mass at the atom's center – the nucleus.


**Problem 2.** Alpha particles that come closer to the nuclei:  

(A) Are deflected more  
(B) Are deflected less  
(C) Make more collisions  
(D) Are slowed down more  

**Solution:** (A) The closer an alpha particle gets to the positively charged nucleus, the stronger the repulsive force, leading to greater deflection.


**Problem 3.** Rutherford observed that:

(A) 50% of the α-particles get deflected  
(B) 99% of the α-particles get deflected  
(C) 99% of the α-particles went straight without suffering any deflection  
(D) The nucleus is negatively charged  

**Solution:** (C)  The vast majority of alpha particles passed through the gold foil undeflected, indicating that most of the atom is empty space.  Only a small fraction experienced significant deflection.
