# ADD TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE
1. Sir Joseph John Thomson discovered the presence of electrons in an atom in the year 1897 by passing electricity at high voltage through a gas at very low pressure.
2. The existence of protons in an atom was shown by Goldstein.
3. The discovery of another fundamental particle known as neutron was done by Chadwick in 1932.
4. Nucleus is small positively charged part at the centre of an atom with electrons revolving around it.
5. Neils Bohr was a Danish Physicist who won the 1922 Noble prize in physics for his work on structure of the atom.
6. Elements having same number of valence electrons in their atoms show similar chemical properties.
7. Isotopes of  
(a) Hydrogen 
    $\rightarrow{ }_1^1 \mathrm{H},{ }_1^2 \mathrm{H}$ and ${ }_1^3 \mathrm{H}$  
    $\rightarrow_1^1 \mathrm{H}$  
(b) Carbon $\rightarrow{ }_6^{12} \mathrm{C}$ and ${ }_6^{14} \mathrm{C}$  
(c) Oxygen $\rightarrow{ }_8^{16} \mathrm{O},{ }_8^{17} \mathrm{O}$ and ${ }_8^{18} \mathrm{O}$  
(d) Neon $\quad \rightarrow{ }_{10}^{20} \mathrm{Ne},{ }_{10}^{21} \mathrm{Ne}$ and ${ }_{10}^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$  
1. Aufbau principle: The german term 'aufbau' means building up or construction. It is stated as "Filling up of electrons in atomic orbitals should be in increasing energy level, where the electrons are filled up in lowest energy level first then the higher.
2. Paul's exclusion principle: It states that, in an atom, no electrons can have the same four electronic quantum numbers.
3.  Hund's rule: It states that, every orbital in a sub-shell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied and all electron in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin.
