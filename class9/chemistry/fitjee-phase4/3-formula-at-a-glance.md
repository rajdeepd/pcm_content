# FORMULAE \& CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE

1. `Cathode rays` were discovered in the year 1879 by `J.J. Thomson.`
2. `Cathode rays` consist of a mass particle called electron.
3. `Protons` were discovered in the year 1886 by Goldstein.
4. `Neutrons` were discovered by `Chadwick in 1932`.
5.` Nucleus` was discovered after $\alpha$-scattering experiment   performed by Rutherford.
6. `Thomson Mode`l of an atom is popularly known as PLUM-PUDDING Model.
7. `Rutherford's model` of an atom was rejected and finally Bohr's model was accepted.
8. `Bohr's energy levels` were named orbits.
9. Total number of protons in the nucleus determines its `atomic number`.
10. Total number of protons and neutrons determines its `mass number`.
11. `Isotopes` of an element have same atomic number but different mass number.

## Important Definitions

**Isotopes** of an element have same atomic number but different mass number.  
**Isobars:** Element having same mass number. i.e. ${ }_6 \mathrm{C}^{14},{ }_7 \mathrm{~N}^{14}$ (i.e. ${ }_z \mathrm{X}^A \quad \mathrm{~A}$ will be similar)

**Isoelectronic:** Species or atoms having same number of electrons. i.e. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{O}^{--}, \mathrm{F}^{-}, \mathrm{Al}^{3+}, \mathrm{N}^{3-}$  

**Isotones:** Species or atoms having same number of neutrons.

### Photon Energy, Frequence and Plank's constant**

   **Photon Energy:** The energy of a photon is related to its frequency and wavelength by the following equation:
        *   E = h * f
        *   Where:
            *   E is the energy of the photon (usually in Joules or ergs)
            *   h is Planck's constant (given as 6.624 x 10<sup>-27</sup> erg-sec)
            *   f is the frequency of the light (in Hertz, Hz or s<sup>-1</sup>)

   **Relationship Between Frequency and Wavelength:**
        *   c = λ * f
        *   Where:
            *   c is the speed of light (approximately 3 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec)
            *   λ is the wavelength of the light (in cm or meters)
            *   f is the frequency of the light (in Hz or s<sup>-1</sup>)

   **Combined Equation:**  We can combine these two equations to relate energy directly to wavelength:
        *   E = h * (c / λ)
        *   E = hc / λ

   **Given Information**

   *   Planck's constant (h) = 6.624 x 10<sup>-27</sup> erg-sec
   *   Speed of light (c) = 3 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec
   *   Wavelength (λ) = 6000 Å
   *
