Solution

1. First quadrant
2. The abscissa of any point on the y-axis is $\fbox{0}$.

    Explanation

    Abscissa: The abscissa is the x-coordinate of a point in a Cartesian coordinate system. It tells you how far the point is to the left or right of the y-axis.

    y-axis: The y-axis is the vertical line in the Cartesian coordinate system. Any point on the y-axis has an x-coordinate of zero.

    Therefore, any point on the y-axis has the form (0, y), where 'y' is any real number. So, the abscissa (x-coordinate) is always 0.

3. Let's analyze this problem:

    *   **Abscissa:** The abscissa is the x-coordinate of a point.
    *   **Ordinate:** The ordinate is the y-coordinate of a point.
    *   **Same Abscissae:** This means the two points have the same x-coordinate. Let's call this x-coordinate 'a'. So, the two points can be represented as (a, y1) and (a, y2), where y1 and y2 are different y-coordinates.
    *   **Different Ordinates:** This means y1 and y2 are not equal (y1 â‰  y2).

    Let's consider the different options:

    *   **(A) x-axis:** Points on the x-axis have a y-coordinate of 0. Since our two points have different y-coordinates, they cannot both lie on the x-axis.
    *   **(B) y-axis:** Points on the y-axis have an x-coordinate of 0. While it's possible that the two points could have an abscissa of 0 and different ordinates, this isn't necessarily the case. The problem only states they have *the same* abscissae, not that the abscissa must be 0.
    *   **(C) a line parallel to y-axis:** A line parallel to the y-axis has the equation x = constant. Since both points have the same x-coordinate 'a', they both lie on the line x = a.
    *   **(D) a line parallel to x-axis:** A line parallel to the x-axis has the equation y = constant. Since the ordinates of our points are different, they cannot both lie on the same horizontal line.

    **Conclusion:**

    The two points must lie on a line that has a constant x value (the same abscissa), which means they lie on a line parallel to the y-axis.

    **Answer:**

    The correct answer is $\fbox{C}$ **a line parallel to y-axis**.

4. Let's analyze this problem:

    *   **Abscissa:** The abscissa is the x-coordinate of a point.
    *   **Ordinate:** The ordinate is the y-coordinate of a point.
    *   **Abscissa equals Ordinate:** This means that the x-coordinate is equal to the y-coordinate. So, the points will have the form (a, a) where 'a' is any real number (other than 0 since we are excluding the origin).

    Let's consider the quadrants of the Cartesian plane:

    *   **Quadrant I:** In Quadrant I, both the x and y coordinates are positive (+, +).  So, if 'a' is a positive number, the point (a,a) would be in Quadrant I.
    *   **Quadrant II:** In Quadrant II, x is negative and y is positive (-, +).  So, we cannot have a = -a, with a != 0, for points in quadrant II.
    *   **Quadrant III:** In Quadrant III, both the x and y coordinates are negative (-,-).  So, if 'a' is a negative number, the point (a,a) would be in Quadrant III, since (-a,-a) in this case means (-a=-a) when a<0, which is consistent.
    *   **Quadrant IV:** In Quadrant IV, x is positive and y is negative (+, -).  So, we cannot have a = -a with a !=0, for points in quadrant IV.

    Therefore, the points where the abscissa equals the ordinate will lie in **Quadrant I** (when 'a' is positive) and **Quadrant III** (when 'a' is negative).

    **Conclusion:**

    The points (other than the origin) for which the abscissa equals the ordinate will lie in Quadrants I and III.

    **Answer:**

    The correct answer is **(C) I and III quadrants**

5. Let's analyze this problem step-by-step:

    *   **Perpendicular Distance from the x-axis:** This refers to the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the point P.  It tells you how far above or below the x-axis the point is.
    *   **Distance of 5 units:** This means the absolute value of the y-coordinate of P is 5 (i.e., |y| = 5). Therefore, the y-coordinate can be either 5 or -5.
    *   **Foot of the Perpendicular on the Negative x-axis:** The "foot of the perpendicular" is the point where the perpendicular line from P intersects the x-axis. Since this foot lies on the negative direction of the x-axis, the x-coordinate of the foot is negative. It does not provide information on the value of the x-coordinate itself, other than the fact that it's negative. This does *not* mean that the x-coordinate of point P is -5, just that it is negative.
    * Since the foot of the perpendicular from point P lies on the negative x-axis, we know that the x-coordinate of the point P is negative.

    **Putting it Together:**

    *   We know that the absolute value of the y-coordinate of P is 5, so the y-coordinate can be either 5 or -5.
    *   The x-coordinate is not specified, other than the fact that it is a negative number. This means that the point P could be located at (some negative x-value, 5) or (some negative x-value, -5).

    Based on the given information, we know that the y coordinate can be either 5 or -5.

    **Analysis of the options:**

    *   **(A) x coordinate = 5:** This is incorrect because we are told the foot of the perpendicular lies on the negative x-axis, so the x coordinate should be a negative value.
    *   **(B) y coordinate = 5 only:** This is incorrect, the y-coordinate can be either 5 or -5.
    *   **(C) y coordinate = -5 only:** This is incorrect, the y-coordinate can be either 5 or -5.
    *   **(D) y coordinate = 5 or -5:** This is correct, as the absolute value of the y-coordinate is 5.

    **Answer:**

    The correct answer is **$\fbox{D}$ y coordinate = 5 or -5**

6. Let's find the area of the triangle with vertices O(0, 0), A(6, 0), and B(0, 8).
   

    **Understanding the Triangle**

    *   **O(0, 0):** This is the origin, the point where the x and y axes intersect.
    *   **A(6, 0):** This point lies on the x-axis, 6 units to the right of the origin.
    *   **B(0, 8):** This point lies on the y-axis, 8 units above the origin.

    This triangle is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at the origin (O). The x-axis segment OA is one leg of the right triangle, and the y-axis segment OB is the other leg.

    **Using the Formula for the Area of a Right Triangle**

    The area of a right-angled triangle is given by:

    Area = (1/2) * base * height

    In this case:

    *   **Base:** The base of the triangle can be considered the length of the segment OA, which is 6 units (the x-coordinate of A).
    *   **Height:** The height of the triangle can be considered the length of the segment OB, which is 8 units (the y-coordinate of B).

    **Calculating the Area**

    Area = (1/2) * 6 * 8  
    Area = (1/2) * 48  
    Area = 24  

    **Answer:**

    The area of the triangle is 24 square units.

    Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{24}$

7. Okay, let's find the perpendicular distance of the point (-7, 4) from the y-axis.

    **Understanding Perpendicular Distance**

    The perpendicular distance of a point from the y-axis is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of the point. This is because the y-axis is a vertical line, and the perpendicular distance is the horizontal distance from the point to the y-axis.

    **Given Point:**

    The point is (-7, 4).
    *   The x-coordinate (abscissa) is -7.
    *   The y-coordinate (ordinate) is 4.

    **Calculating Perpendicular Distance**

    1.  **Identify the x-coordinate:** The x-coordinate of the point is -7.
    2.  **Take the absolute value:** The perpendicular distance is the absolute value of the x-coordinate, which is |-7|.
    3.  **Calculate the result:** |-7| = 7.

    **Answer:**

    The perpendicular distance of the point (-7, 4) from the y-axis is 7 units.

    Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{7}$

8. Find the reflection of the point $(-4,5)$ in $y$-axis .
   It is (4,5)

9.  Okay, let's find the area of the figure formed by joining the points A(-1, 1), B(5, 1), C(5, 6), and D(-1, 6).

    **Understanding the Figure**

    Plotting these points on a coordinate plane will reveal that they form a rectangle.
    *   Points A and B have the same y-coordinate (y=1). They form a horizontal segment AB.
    *   Points B and C have the same x-coordinate (x=5). They form a vertical segment BC.
    *   Points C and D have the same y-coordinate (y=6). They form a horizontal segment CD.
    *   Points D and A have the same x-coordinate (x=-1). They form a vertical segment DA.
    *   The sides are perpendicular.

    Therefore, the shape formed is a rectangle.

    **Finding the Length and Width**

    *   **Length:** The length of the rectangle can be found by calculating the distance between A(-1, 1) and B(5, 1). Since the y-coordinates are the same, we can simply subtract the x-coordinates:
        Length = |5 - (-1)| = |5 + 1| = 6
    *   **Width:** The width of the rectangle can be found by calculating the distance between B(5, 1) and C(5, 6). Since the x-coordinates are the same, we can simply subtract the y-coordinates:
        Width = |6 - 1| = 5

    **Calculating the Area**

    The area of a rectangle is given by:

    Area = Length * Width
    Area = 6 * 5
    Area = 30

    **Answer**
    The area of the figure formed by joining the points A, B, C, and D is 30 square units.

    Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{30}$

10.  The line represented by the equation $8 x+3 y=24$ cuts the coordinate axes at $A$ and
B. Find the area of the triangle AOB .

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

**Given:**

*   The equation of the line is 8x + 3y = 24.
*   The line intersects the coordinate axes at points A and B.
*   O is the origin (0, 0).

**Goal:**

*   Find the area of triangle AOB.

    **1. Find the Coordinates of A and B**

    *   **Point A (x-intercept):** The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, so y = 0. Substitute y = 0 into the equation:
        8x + 3(0) = 24
        8x = 24
        x = 3
        So, point A is (3, 0).

    *   **Point B (y-intercept):** The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, so x = 0. Substitute x = 0 into the equation:
        8(0) + 3y = 24
        3y = 24
        y = 8
        So, point B is (0, 8).

    **2. Visualize Triangle AOB**

    Triangle AOB is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at the origin O(0, 0).
    *   The base of the triangle (along the x-axis) is the segment OA, which has length 3 (from (0, 0) to (3, 0)).
    *   The height of the triangle (along the y-axis) is the segment OB, which has length 8 (from (0, 0) to (0, 8)).

    **3. Calculate the Area of Triangle AOB**

    The area of a right-angled triangle is given by:

    Area = (1/2) * base * height

    In this case:

    *   Base = 3 (length of OA)
    *   Height = 8 (length of OB)

    Area = (1/2) * 3 * 8
    Area = (1/2) * 24
    Area = 12

    **Answer:**

    The area of triangle AOB is 12 square units.

    Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{12}$
