### **Question 1**: 
The sum of the radius of the base and the height of a solid cylinder is 12cm. If its total surface area is
540 sq cm, then the circumference of its base is

**Solution**

**Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Solid Cylinder:** A solid cylinder is a three-dimensional geometric shape with two circular bases connected by a curved surface.
*   **Radius (r):** The radius of the circular base of the cylinder.
*   **Height (h):** The distance between the two circular bases.
*   **Total Surface Area (TSA):** The total area of all the surfaces of the cylinder, which includes the area of the two circular bases and the curved surface.
*   **Circumference (C):** The perimeter of the circular base, given by `C = 2πr`.

**Formulas**

*   **Area of a circle:**  `A = πr²`
*   **Curved surface area of a cylinder:** `CSA = 2πrh`
*   **Total surface area of a cylinder:** `TSA = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr(r + h)`
*   **Circumference of a circle:** `C = 2πr`

**Given Information**

*   `r + h = 12 cm` (sum of the radius and height)
*   `TSA = 540 cm²` (total surface area)

**Solution**

1.  **Total Surface Area Equation:**

    We have the total surface area equation:

    `TSA = 2πr(r + h)`

    Substitute the given values:

    `540 = 2πr(12)`

2.  **Solve for `r`:**
     Divide both sides by `2π*12`:

    `540 / (24π) = r`

    `r = 540 / (24π)`

    `r = 22.5 / π `  (approximately)

3.  **Solve for circumference:**

    Now we need to find the circumference, which is:

    `C = 2πr`

    Substitute the value of `r` we just found into the equation

     `C = 2π (540 / (24π))`

     `C = 540 * 2 * π /(24 * π)`

     `C = 540 * 2 / 24`

     `C = 540 /12 `

     `C = 45`

**Answer**

The circumference of the base of the cylinder is $\fbox{45cm}$.



### Question 2 

If the volume of a sphere is numerally equal to its surface area, then diameter of the sphere is
Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

**Formulas**

*   **Volume of a sphere:**  `V = (4/3)πr³`
*   **Surface area of a sphere:** `SA = 4πr²`

**Given Information**

*   The volume of the sphere is numerically equal to its surface area: `V = SA`.

**Solution**

1.  **Set Up the Equation:**

    We're given that the numerical values of the volume and surface area are equal. So, we can write:

    `(4/3)πr³ = 4πr²`

2.  **Solve for Radius (r):**

    *   Divide both sides by `π`:

        `(4/3)r³ = 4r²`

    *   Divide both sides by `4`:

         `(1/3)r³ = r²`

    * Divide both sides by `r²` (we know `r` can't be zero):
          `(1/3) r = 1`
        `r = 3`

3.  **Calculate Diameter (d):**

    We know that the diameter is twice the radius:

    `d = 2r`
    `d = 2(3)`
    `d = 6`

**Answer**

The diameter of the sphere is 6 units. Since no specific units were mentioned in the question, we can just say the diameter is 6.

### Question 3
The radius of the hemisphere whose curved surface area is 308 cm2
is

#### Solution

Okay, let's solve this problem step by step.

**Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Hemisphere:** A hemisphere is exactly half of a sphere.
*   **Radius (r):** The distance from the center of the hemisphere to any point on its curved surface or on the circular base.
*   **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** The area of the curved portion of the hemisphere (excluding the flat, circular base).

**Formulas**

*   **Surface area of a sphere:** `4πr²`
*   **Curved surface area (CSA) of a hemisphere:**  Half the surface area of a sphere: `2πr²`

**Given Information**

*   `CSA = 308 cm²` (Curved surface area of the hemisphere)

**Solution**

1.  **Curved Surface Area Equation:**

    We have the curved surface area equation for a hemisphere:

    `CSA = 2πr²`

    Substitute the given value:

    `308 = 2πr²`

2.  **Solve for `r²`:**
      Divide both sides by `2π`:

    `308 / (2π) = r²`

    `154 / π = r²`

3.  **Solve for `r`:**

     Take the square root of both sides to get `r`:

    `r = sqrt(154/π)`

4.  **Calculate Value:**

      Using  `π` as approximately `22/7` or `3.14159`

      `r = sqrt(154/(22/7))`
      `r = sqrt(154 * 7/22)`
      `r = sqrt(7*7)`
      `r = 7`

**Answer**

The radius of the hemisphere is 7 cm.

*   **Side (a):** The length of one side (or edge) of the cube.
*   **Surface Area (SA):** The total area of all six faces of the cube.
*   **Volume (V):** The amount of space enclosed by the cube.

**Formulas**

*   **Surface Area of a cube:** `SA = 6a²`
*   **Volume of a cube:** `V = a³`

**Given Information**

*   The numerical value of the surface area of the cube is equal to the numerical value of its volume: `SA = V`

**Solution**

1.  **Set Up the Equation:**

    We're given that the numerical values of the surface area and the volume are equal:

    `6a² = a³`

2.  **Solve for `a`:**

    *   Divide both sides by `a²` (we know `a` cannot be 0):

        `6 = a`

3.  **Calculate Volume (V):**

    Now that we know the side length `a = 6`, we can find the volume using the formula:

    `V = a³`
    `V = 6³`
    `V = 6 * 6 * 6`
    `V = 216`

**Answer**

The volume of the cube is 216 cubic units. Since no specific units are given in the question we can just write "216".

The difference of the outside and inside curved surface areas of a cylindrical pipe of length 14 cm is 88
cm2
. The thickness of the pipe is

**Solution**
Okay, let's break down this problem and find the thickness of the cylindrical pipe.

**Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Cylindrical Pipe:** A hollow cylinder, characterized by an inner radius, an outer radius, and a length.
*   **Length (h):** The length of the pipe (given as 14 cm).
*   **Outer Radius (R):** The radius of the outer surface of the pipe.
*   **Inner Radius (r):** The radius of the inner surface of the pipe.
*   **Thickness (t):** The difference between the outer and inner radius of the pipe, i.e., `t = R - r`.
*   **Curved Surface Area (CSA):** The area of the curved surfaces of the cylinder (excluding the circular ends).

**Formulas**

*   **Curved surface area (CSA) of a cylinder:** `CSA = 2πrh` where r is radius and h is the height/length.
*   **Thickness (t):** `t = R - r`

**Given Information**

*   **Length of the pipe (h):** 14 cm
*   **Difference between outer and inner curved surface areas:** 88 cm²

**Solution**

1.  **Curved Surface Areas:**

    *   Outer curved surface area (CSA_outer): `CSA_outer = 2πRh`
    *   Inner curved surface area (CSA_inner): `CSA_inner = 2πrh`

2.  **Difference of CSAs:**

    We are given that the difference between these areas is 88 cm²:
    `CSA_outer - CSA_inner = 88`
    `2πRh - 2πrh = 88`
    `2πh(R - r) = 88`

3.  **Substitute values and Simplify**

     Substitute the length of the cylinder `h = 14cm`
    `2 * π * 14 * (R - r) = 88`

    `28 * π * (R - r) = 88`

     `(R-r) = 88 / (28π)`

     Since thickness is given by `t = R - r` then we have:

     `t = 88 / (28π)`

     `t = 22 / (7π)`

    If we use the value of `π=22/7`, we can further simplify

     `t = 22 / (7 * 22/7) = 22 / 22 = 1`

**Answer**

The thickness of the pipe is $ \fbox{1 cm}$.


### Question 6
If the circumference of the circular top of a hemispherical bowl is 132cm, then find the depth of the bowl.

    Substitute the given circumference value and solve for the radius `r`:

    `132 = 2πr`

     `r = 132 / (2π)`

     `r = 66 / π`

3. **Substitute Value of Pi:**

     If we substitute `π=22/7`, then:
      `r = 66 / (22/7) = 66 * (7/22) = 3*7 = 21`

4.  **Depth and Radius:**

     The depth of a hemispherical bowl is equal to its radius:

    `h = r`

     Therefore, `h = 21 cm`

**Answer**

The depth of the bowl is 21 cm.

2.  **Volume of the pencil:** `V_pencil = π * r_pencil² * h`
   `V_pencil = π * (0.35 cm)² * 14 cm`
   `V_pencil = 1.715π cm³`

3.  **Volume of the wood:** `V_wood = V_pencil - V_graphite`
    `V_wood = 1.715π cm³ - 0.035π cm³`
    `V_wood = 1.68π cm³`
     `V_wood = 1.68 * 22 /7 cm³`
     `V_wood = 0.24 * 22 cm³`
     `V_wood =  5.28 cm³`

*  **Answer (ii): B. 5.28 cm³**

**Part iii: Number of Pencils in a Cylindrical Box**

1.  **Radius of the cylindrical box:** `r_box = 21 cm / 2 = 10.5 cm`
2.  **Volume of the cylindrical box:** `V_box = π * r_box² * h`
    `V_box = π * (10.5 cm)² * 14 cm`
    `V_box = 1543.5π cm³`
   `V_box = 1543.5 * 22 /7 cm³`
  `V_box = 4851 cm³`

3.  **Number of pencils in the box:**
    `Pencils_in_box = V_box / V_pencil`
    `Pencils_in_box = 4851 cm³ / 1.715π cm³`
   `Pencils_in_box = 4851 / (1.715 * 22/7)`
   `Pencils_in_box = 4851 / 5.387 `
    `Pencils_in_box = 900` (approximately)

    Because we can only fit whole pencils in the box we must round down the answer.

*   **Answer (iii): C. 900**

**Part iv: Number of Pencils from a Wooden Block**

1. **Volume of the wooden block:** `V_block = 36cm × 12cm × 11cm`
    `V_block = 4752 cm³`
2. **Volume of wood per pencil:** The volume of wood per pencil is `V_wood = 5.28cm³`

3. **Number of pencils from the wooden block:**
    `Pencils_from_block = V_block / V_wood`
    `Pencils_from_block= 4752 cm³ / 5.28 cm³`
    `Pencils_from_block= 900`

*   **Answer (iv): C. 900**
