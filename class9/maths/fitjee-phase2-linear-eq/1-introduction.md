# Linear Equation In TWO VARIABLES-1 

## INTRODUCTION  

In this chapter we shall review linear equations in one variable. Then we shall learn how to solve linear equations in two variables. For this we shall learn graphical representation of a point in a plane. We shall represent a point with the help of two numbers known as coordinates of that point. The concept of coordinates was given by the French Mathematician Rene Descartes (1596-1650), which integrates Algebra and geometry.
