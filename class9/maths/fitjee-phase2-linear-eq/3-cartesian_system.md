## CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM

### Rectangular coordinate axes

Let $X^{\prime} O X$ and YOY' be two mutually perpendicular lines through any point $O$ in the plane of the paper. This point $O$ is known as the origin. The line $X^{\prime} O X$ is called the $x$-axis or the axis of $X$, the line $Y O Y^{\prime}$ is called the $y$-axis or axis of $Y$ and the two lines taken together are called the coordinate axes or the axes of coordinates.

Now we choose a convenient unit of length and starting from the origin O as zero, mark off a number scale on horizontal line $X^{\prime} O X$, positive to right of origin O and negative to the left of origin O . Similarly we mark off the same scale on vertical line YOY', positive upwards and negative downwards of the origin O .

### Cartesian coordinates of a point

Let $X^{\prime} O X$ and $Y O Y^{\prime}$ be the coordinate axes and let $P$ be any point in the plane. We draw perpendiculars PM and PN from $P$ on $x$ and $y$-axis respectively. The length of the directed line segment $O M$ in the units of scale chosen is called the $x$-coordinate or abscissa of point $P$. Similarly, the length of the directed line segment $O N$ on the same scale is called the $y$-coordinate or ordinate of point $P$.

The system of coordinating an ordered pair $(x, y)$ with every point in a plane is called Rectangular Cartesian system.
Thus, corresponding to every point $P$ in the Euclidean plane, there is a unique ordered pair $(x, y)$ of real numbers called its Cartesian co-ordinates. Conversely, when we are given an ordered pair ( $x, y$ ) and a Cartesian coordinate system we can determine a point in the plane having its coordinates $(x, y)$.
The coordinates of the origin are taken as $(0,0)$. The coordinates of any point on $x$-axis are of the form $(x, 0)$ and the coordinates of any point on $y$-axis are of the form $(0, y)$. Thus if the abscissa of a point is zero, it will lie some where on the $y$-axis and if its ordinate is zero, it will lie on $x$-axis.

### Quadrants

Let $X^{\prime} O X$ and YOY' be the coordinate axis. These axes divide the plane into four parts, known as the quadrants. The regions XOY, X'OY, X'OY' and $Y^{\prime} O X$ are known as the first, second, third and fourth quadrants respectively.

OX and OX' are taken as positive and negative directions respectively of $x$-axis and similarly $O Y$ and $O Y^{\prime}$ are taken as the positive and negative directions respectively of y -axis.

The following table gives the sign scheme of $x$ and $y$-coordinates of a point according to its location in different quadrants.

| Location of point | Sign of $x$-coordinate | Sign of $y$-coordinate | Sign of $(x, y)$ |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| I quadrant | + | + | $(+,+)$ |
| II quadrant | - | + | $(-,+)$ |
| III quadrant | - | - | $(-,-)$ |
| IV quadrant | + | - | $(+,-)$ |

#### Plotting of points on graph paper


The process of marking a point with the help of given coordinates is known as plotting of a point. The squared paper, also known as the graph paper is used for this purpose. First of all, we draw two perpendicular lines  
$X^{\prime} O X$ and YOY'. These are taken as the axes of coordinates on the graph paper. Now, suppose we have to plot the point $(4,5)$. We start by counting 4 divisions on the $x$-axis to the right of $O$ and then 5 divisions upwards i.e. along $y$-axis and mark the point so obtained. This point is denoted by $P$. If we draw lines parallel to $X O$ and $Y O$ from $P$ meeting them in $N$ and $M$, then $P M=5$ units and $P N=4$ units. Hence $P$ is the point $(4,5)$, which lies in Ist quadrant. Now, we plot the point $(-4,5)$. Since its abscissa is negative and ordinate positive it lies in Ilnd quadrant. Therefore we count 4 divisions to the left of $O$ and then 5 divisions upwards and mark the point so obtained. This is the point $(-4,5)$.

Similarly, to plot a point $(-4,-5)$, which lies in IIIrd quadrant, we move 4 divisions to the left of $O$ and then 5 divisions downwards i.e. in negative direction of $y$-axis and mark the point obtained. This is the point $(-4,-5)$.
Lastly we plot a point $(4,-5)$. First we count divisions on the right of $O$ and on $x$-axis and then 5 divisions downwards and mark the point. This is the point $(4,-5)$, which lies in the IVth quadrant.


**$\sigma$ Illustration 5**:  
In which quadrants do the following points lie? 
(i) $(3,-7)$  
(ii) $(-1,-9)$  
(iii) $\left(2, \frac{13}{2}\right)$  
(iv) $\left(-\frac{5}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)$  

Solution: (i) In the point $(3,-7)$, we have $x>0, y<0$. So it lies in IVth quadrant.  
(ii) In the point $(-1,-9)$, both $x$ and $y$ coordinates are negative. Therefore it lies in IIIrd quadrant.    
(iii) The point $\left(2, \frac{13}{2}\right)$ lies in Ist quadrant, since both $x$ and $y$ coordinates are positive.  
(iv) The point $\left(-\frac{5}{2}, \frac{7}{2}\right)$ lies in IInd quadrant.
