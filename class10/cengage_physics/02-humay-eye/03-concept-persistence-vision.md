# Concept: Persistence of Vision

---

## Definition

It is the ability of the eye to see the continue image of an object for very small interval of time even after the removal of the object.

The image of an object persists on the retina for nearly \\(\frac{1}{16}\\) of a second after the removal of the object.

## Explanation

Due to the persistence of vision, we are unable to detect discontinuity between the frames of a movie's pictures in the cinema hall as the frame rate is 24 frames per second.

## Applications

### 1. Cinema/Movies

> **TODO:** Extract how movies work based on persistence of vision

### 2. Animation

> **TODO:** Extract animation application

### 3. Other Applications

> **TODO:** Extract other applications if mentioned
