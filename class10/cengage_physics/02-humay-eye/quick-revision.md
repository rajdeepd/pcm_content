# Quick Revision Notes

---

## Human Eye

> **TODO:** Extract key points

**Parts:**
- Cornea: Transparent front part, most refraction occurs here
- Iris: Controls pupil size
- Pupil: Opening for light entry
- Lens: Fine adjustment of focus
- Ciliary muscles: Control lens shape
- Retina: Light-sensitive screen
- Optic nerve: Carries signals to brain

**Accommodation:** Ability to focus on objects at different distances

**Range:** Near point (25 cm) to far point (infinity)

---

## Defects of Vision

> **TODO:** Extract summary table

| Defect | Problem | Cause | Correction |
|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| Myopia | Can't see distant objects | Elongated eyeball | Concave lens |
| Hypermetropia | Can't see near objects | Shortened eyeball | Convex lens |
| Presbyopia | Can't see both | Old age | Bifocal lens |

## Refraction Through Prism

> **TODO:** Extract key points

- Light bends towards the base
- Different colors deviate differently
- Violet deviates most, red deviates least
- At minimum deviation: $i = e$

---

## Dispersion

> **TODO:** Extract key points

- Splitting of white light into seven colors
- VIBGYOR sequence
- Caused by different refractive indices for different colors
- Can be recombined to get white light

---

## Atmospheric Phenomena

> **TODO:** Extract key points

**Atmospheric Refraction:**
- Twinkling of stars: Due to changing refractive index of air
- Advanced sunrise/delayed sunset: ~2 min each, total 4 min longer day

**Scattering:**
- Sky is blue: Blue light scatters more (λ⁻⁴ law)
- Sun is red at sunrise/sunset: Blue scattered away, red reaches us
- Sky is dark in space: No atmosphere to scatter

---

## Colors

> **TODO:** Extract key points

**Primary colors of light:** Red, Green, Blue (RGB)

**Secondary colors:**
- Red + Green = Yellow
- Green + Blue = Cyan
- Red + Blue = Magenta

**Complementary colors:** Two colors that produce white light when added

---

## Important Facts to Remember

> **TODO:** Extract important facts

1. Rainbow is formed by dispersion + internal reflection in water droplets
2. Red color used for danger signals (least scattered, visible from far)
3. Planets don't twinkle (extended sources)
4. White clouds: All colors scattered equally by large water droplets
5. Power in diopters = 1/focal length in meters

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

> **TODO:** Add common mistakes

1. Don't confuse near point and far point
2. Remember: Concave for myopia, Convex for hypermetropia
3. Power sign: negative for concave, positive for convex
4. In lens formula: object distance (u) is always negative
5. Scattering ∝ 1/λ⁴ not 1/λ

---

## Mnemonics

> **TODO:** Add mnemonics

**VIBGYOR:** Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red

**ROY G. BIV:** Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet (reverse)
