## Question 1

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2012</span>

**Question:** How does the thickness of the eye lens change when we shift looking from a distant tree to reading a book?

**Solution:**

When we shift from looking at a distant tree to reading a book:

- **For distant object (tree):** The ciliary muscles are **relaxed**, making the eye lens **thinner** (less convex). This increases the focal length.

- **For near object (book):** The ciliary muscles **contract**, making the eye lens **thicker** (more convex). This decreases the focal length.

**Answer:** The thickness of the eye lens **increases** (becomes thicker) when we shift from looking at a distant tree to reading a book.

## Question 2

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2014</span>

**Question:**

**(i)** List the parts of the human eye that control the amount of light entering into it. Explain, how they performs this function?

**(ii)** Write the function of retina in human eye.

**(iii)** Do you know that the corneal-impairment can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of the donated eye? How and why should we organise groups to motivate the community members to donate their eyes after death?

**Solution:**

**(i) Parts controlling light entry:**

**Parts:** **Iris** and **Pupil**

**How they function:**
- **Iris:** It is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.
- **Pupil:** It is the opening in the iris through which light enters.
- In **bright light:** Iris contracts → Pupil becomes smaller → Less light enters
- In **dim light:** Iris expands → Pupil becomes larger → More light enters

**(ii) Function of retina:**

The retina is the light-sensitive screen at the back of the eye where:
- The image is formed by the eye lens
- It contains light-sensitive cells (rods and cones)
- These cells generate electrical signals when light falls on them
- These signals are sent to the brain through optic nerves
- The brain interprets these signals and we perceive the image

**(iii) Eye donation and community motivation:**

**Corneal transplant:** The defective cornea can be replaced with a healthy cornea from a donated eye, restoring vision.

**How to motivate:**
1. **Awareness campaigns:** Organize talks and seminars in schools, colleges, and communities
2. **Success stories:** Share inspiring stories of people who regained sight through corneal transplant
3. **Pledge drives:** Encourage people to pledge their eyes
4. **Information dissemination:** Distribute pamphlets and posters about eye donation
5. **Collaboration:** Work with eye banks and hospitals
6. **Religious/social leaders:** Involve them to spread the message

**Why it's important:**
- Corneal blindness can be cured through donation
- One person can give vision to two people
- Eye donation doesn't disfigure the face
- It's the greatest gift one can give
- Creates awareness about organ donation

## Question 3

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2015</span>

**Question:** State one main function each of iris, pupil, and cornea.

**Solution:**

| Part | Main Function |
|------|---------------|
| **Iris** | Controls the size of the pupil and thus regulates the amount of light entering the eye |
| **Pupil** | Allows light to enter the eye (acts as an opening/aperture) |
| **Cornea** | Refracts (bends) most of the light entering the eye and protects the eye |

## Question 4

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2015</span>

**Question:** Mention the factor on which scattering of light depends. Explain, why the colour of the clear sky is blue? An astronaut in space finds sky to be dark. Explain reason for this observation.

**Solution:**

**Factor on which scattering depends:**

Scattering of light depends on the **wavelength of light** (or **size of particles** relative to wavelength).

According to **Rayleigh's scattering law:**
$$\text{Scattering} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light.

**Why is the sky blue?**

1. Sunlight consists of seven colors (VIBGYOR) with different wavelengths
2. Blue light has a **shorter wavelength** compared to red light
3. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it encounters air molecules and dust particles
4. Blue light is **scattered much more** than red light (because scattering ∝ 1/λ⁴)
5. When we look at the sky, we see this scattered blue light coming from all directions
6. Therefore, the sky appears **blue**

**Why does an astronaut see a dark sky?**

1. In space, there is **no atmosphere** (no air molecules)
2. Without particles to scatter sunlight, **no scattering occurs**
3. Only direct sunlight from the sun is visible
4. The sky appears **black/dark** because there are no scattered light rays reaching the astronaut's eyes

## Question 5

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2016</span>

**Question:** What is atmospheric refraction? Use this phenomenon to explain the following natural events.

**(i)** Twinkling of stars  
**(ii)** Advantages sunrise and delayed sunset.

Draw diagrams to illustrate your answers.

**Solution:**

**Atmospheric Refraction:**

Atmospheric refraction is the phenomenon of bending of light rays as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere having layers of different optical densities (due to different temperatures and densities).

**(i) Twinkling of stars:**

**Explanation:**
1. Stars are very far away and act as point sources of light
2. Light from stars passes through different layers of atmosphere with varying densities
3. Due to atmospheric refraction, the path of light changes continuously
4. The **apparent position** of the star changes slightly
5. The amount of light reaching our eyes also changes
6. This causes the star to appear brighter or dimmer alternately
7. This is called **twinkling**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing star light passing through atmospheric layers

**Why don't planets twinkle?**
- Planets are closer and appear as extended sources
- Light comes from many points, and changes average out

**(ii) Advanced sunrise and delayed sunset:**

**Explanation:**

**Advanced Sunrise:**
1. Before actual sunrise, the sun is below the horizon
2. Light from the sun enters the atmosphere and gets refracted
3. Due to atmospheric refraction, light bends towards the normal
4. The sun appears to be **above the horizon** even when it's actually below
5. We see the sun about **2 minutes earlier** than actual sunrise

**Delayed Sunset:**
1. After actual sunset, the sun goes below the horizon
2. But due to atmospheric refraction, we still see the sun for some time
3. The sun appears to be **above the horizon** even when it's actually below
4. We see the sun about **2 minutes later** than actual sunset

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing atmospheric refraction at sunrise/sunset

**Net effect:** Day is longer by about **4 minutes** (2 min for sunrise + 2 min for sunset)

## Question 6

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2018</span>

**Question:**
**(i)** A student is unable to see clearly the words written on the black board placed at a distance of approximately 3 m from him. Name the defect of vision the boy is suffering from. State the possible causes of this defect and explain the method of correcting it.
**(ii)** Why do stars twinkle? Explain.

**Solution:**

**(i) Defect of vision and correction:**
- **Defect:** **Myopia** (Near-sightedness). Since the student cannot see objects beyond a certain distance (3 m), his far point has come closer.
- **Causes:**
  1. Excessive curvature of the eye lens.
  2. Elongation of the eyeball.
- **Correction:** This defect is corrected by using a **concave (diverging) lens** of suitable focal length. This lens forms the image of the distant object back onto the retina.

**(ii) Twinkling of stars:**
Stars twinkle due to **atmospheric refraction** of starlight.
1. Stars are very far away and act as point sources.
2. The light entering the Earth's atmosphere undergoes continuous refraction as it passes through layers of different optical densities.
3. The atmospheric conditions (density and temperature) keep changing continuously.
4. As a result, the path of light from the star varies, and its **apparent position** keeps changing.
5. The amount of light reaching our eyes also fluctuates, making the star appear brighter or dimmer. This combined effect is perceived as twinkling.

## Question 7

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2018</span>

**Question:**
**(a)** Write the function of each of the following parts of human eye.
**(i)** Cornea  
**(ii)** Iris  
**(iii)** Crystalline lens  
**(iv)** Ciliary muscles

**(b)** Why does the sun appear reddish early in the morning? Will this phenomenon be observed by an astronaut on the moon? Give reason to justify your answer.

**Solution:**

**(a) Functions of eye parts:**
- **(i) Cornea:** Refracts (bends) most of the light entering the eye.
- **(ii) Iris:** Controls the size of the pupil to regulate the amount of light entering the eye.
- **(iii) Crystalline lens:** Adjusts the focal length to form a sharp image of objects at different distances on the retina.
- **(iv) Ciliary muscles:** Modifies the curvature of the eye lens to adjust its focal length (Power of Accommodation).

**(b) Reddish appearance of the sun:**
- In the morning, sunlight travels through a **longer distance** in the Earth's atmosphere.
- Most of the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are **scattered away** by air molecules and particles.
- The light that reaches our eyes is primarily composed of **longer wavelengths (red)**. Hence, the sun appears reddish.
- **On the Moon:** This phenomenon will **not** be observed. This is because the Moon has **no atmosphere**. Without an atmosphere, there is no scattering of light, and the sky appears dark.

## Question 8

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** What is rainbow? Draw a labelled diagram showing the formation of a rainbow?

**Solution:**

**Rainbow:** A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower. it is produced by the **dispersion of sunlight** by tiny water droplets present in the atmosphere.

**Formation:**
1. Water droplets act like small prisms.
2. They **refract** and **disperse** the incident sunlight.
3. Then they reflect it **internally** (internal reflection).
4. Finally, they **refract** it again as it comes out of the droplet.
5. Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different colors reach the observer's eye.

> **TODO:** Add labelled diagram of rainbow formation showing refraction, dispersion, and internal reflection in a water droplet.

---

## Question 9

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** What is the cause of dispersion of white light through a glass prism? Draw a ray diagram to show the path of light when two identical glass prisms are arranged together in inverted position with respect to each other and a narrow beam of white light is allowed to fall obliquely on one of the faces of the prisms.

**Solution:**

**Cause of Dispersion:**
The cause of dispersion is that **different colors of light travel at different speeds** in a glass prism. When white light enters glass, each color refracts (bends) by a different angle depending on its wavelength. Red bends the least, while violet bends the most.

**Ray Diagram (Newton's Double Prism Experiment):**
- When white light passes through the first prism, it gets dispersed into its seven constituent colors.
- When these colors fall on the second inverted prism, they recombine to form white light again.

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing two prisms (one upright, one inverted) where white light → spectrum → white light.

---

## Question 10

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** What is scattering of light? Use this phenomenon to explain why (i) the sun appears reddish at sunrise and (ii) the clear sky appears blue?

**Solution:**

**Scattering of light:** Scattering is the phenomenon where light rays get deviated in different directions after striking particles (like atoms, molecules, or dust) in their path.

**(i) Reddish sun at sunrise:**
- During sunrise, sunlight travels through a **thick layer of atmosphere**.
- Shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) are **scattered away**.
- The light reaching our eyes is dominated by **longer wavelengths (red)**.

**(ii) Blue sky:**
- The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere are smaller than the wavelength of visible light.
- These particles are more effective in scattering light of **shorter wavelengths** (blue end) than light of longer wavelengths (red end).
- When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the **blue color** more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters our eyes.

## Question 11

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** Define the term power of accommodation. Discuss the modification in the curvature of the eye lens which enables us to see the nearby objects clearly.

**Solution:**

**Power of Accommodation:** The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length to see both distant and nearby objects clearly is called the power of accommodation.

**Modification for nearby objects:**
1. When we look at nearby objects, the **ciliary muscles contract**.
2. This makes the eye lens **thicker** (more convex/curved).
3. As the curvature increases, the **focal length decreases**.
4. This enables us to form a sharp image of the nearby object on the retina.

---

## Question 12

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** Write the structure of eye lens and state the role of ciliary muscles in the human eye.

**Solution:**

**Structure of Eye Lens:**
The eye lens is a **fibrous, jelly-like material**. It is a **transparent, biconvex crystalline structure** made of proteins. It is flexible, allowing its shape to be changed by the ciliary muscles.

**Role of Ciliary Muscles:**
1. They **modify the curvature** of the eye lens.
2. By changing the curvature, they **adjust the focal length** of the eye lens.
3. This adjustment allows the eye to focus on objects at various distances (Power of Accommodation).
4. When they relax, the lens becomes thin (for distant vision). When they contract, the lens becomes thick (for near vision).

---

## Question 13

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** A person is unable to see objects distinctly placed within 50 cm from his eyes.
**(i)** Name the defect of vision the person is suffering from and list its two possible causes.
**(ii)** Draw a ray diagram to show the defect in the above case.
**(iii)** Mention the type of lens used by him for correction of the defect and calculate its power. Assume that the near point for the normal eye is 25 cm.
**(iv)** Draw a labelled diagram for the correction of the defect in the above case.

**Solution:**

**(i) Defect and Causes:**
- **Defect:** **Hypermetropia** (Far-sightedness). The person cannot see objects closer than 50 cm (near point has receded).
- **Causes:**
  1. Focal length of the eye lens is too long.
  2. Eyeball has become too small.

**(ii) Ray diagram for defect:**
> **TODO:** Add diagram showing light from 25 cm focusing behind the retina.

**(iii) Correction and Power calculation:**
- **Lens Type:** **Convex (converging) lens**.
- **Calculation:**
  - Object distance ($u$) = $-25$ cm (normal near point)
  - Image distance ($v$) = $-50$ cm (person's actual near point)
  - Using lens formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
  - $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-50} - \frac{1}{-25} = -\frac{1}{50} + \frac{1}{25} = \frac{-1 + 2}{50} = \frac{1}{50}$
  - $f = 50$ cm $= 0.5$ m
  - Power ($P$) = $\frac{1}{f(\text{in m})} = \frac{1}{0.5} = \mathbf{+2 \text{ D}}$

**(iv) Labelled diagram for correction:**
> **TODO:** Add diagram showing convex lens shifting the image forward onto the retina.

---

## Question 14

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** Trace the sequence of events which occur when bright light is focused on your eyes.

**Solution:**

When bright light falls on the eyes:
1. The **photoreceptors** (specifically cones) on the retina detect the high intensity of light.
2. Electrical impulses are generated and sent to the brain via the **optic nerve**.
3. The brain processes this information and sends a signal back to the **iris**.
4. The muscles of the **iris contract**.
5. This contraction results in the **constriction of the pupil** (pupil becomes smaller).
6. As a result, the **amount of light entering the eye is reduced**, protecting the retina from damage and allowing for clearer vision.

---

## Question 15

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** How can change of size of eyeball be one of the reason for
**(i)** myopic and **(ii)** hypermetropic eye
Compare the size of eyeball with that of a normal eye in each case. How does this change of size affect the position of image in each case?

**Solution:**

**(i) Myopic Eye:**
- **Reason:** The eyeball has become **too long** (elongated).
- **Comparison:** The eyeball is larger than a normal eye.
- **Effect on Image:** Because the eyeball is long, the light rays from a distant object are focused **in front of the retina** instead of on it.

**(ii) Hypermetropic Eye:**
- **Reason:** The eyeball has become **too short**.
- **Comparison:** The eyeball is smaller than a normal eye.
- **Effect on Image:** Because the eyeball is short, the light rays from a nearby object are focused **behind the retina** instead of on it.

## Question 16

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** What happens to the image distance in the normal human eye when we decrease the distance of an object say 10 m to 1 m? Justify the answer.

**Solution:**

In a normal human eye, the **image distance remains unchanged** (it is fixed, equal to the distance between the eye lens and the retina, approximately 2.3 cm).

**Justification:**
When the object distance decreases (from 10 m to 1 m):
1. The **ciliary muscles contract**.
2. This increases the curvature of the eye lens, making it **thicker**.
3. As a result, the **focal length of the lens decreases**.
4. This adjustment (Power of Accommodation) ensures that the image is always formed precisely on the **retina**, regardless of the change in object distance.

---

## Question 17

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:** When we increase the distance of an object from the eye, the image distance from the eye lens in the normal eye
**(1)** increase
**(2)** decreases
**(3)** remains unchanged
**(4)** depends on the size of the eyeball

**Solution:**

**Answer: (3) remains unchanged**

**Explanation:** The image distance in the eye is the distance from the lens to the retina, which is constant. To accommodate objects at different distances, the eye changes its focal length, not the image distance.

---

## Question 18

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:** The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes mainly because
**(1)** scattering of light is not enough at such heights
**(2)** there is no atmosphere at great heights
**(3)** the size of molecules is smaller than the wavelength of visible light
**(4)** the light gets scattered towards the earth

**Solution:**

**Answer: (1) scattering of light is not enough at such heights**

**Explanation:** At very high altitudes, the density of air molecules and other particles is very low. Since there aren't enough particles to scatter sunlight, the sky appears dark/black instead of blue.

---

## Question 19

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:** A student uses spectacles of focal length $- 2.5$ m.
**(i)** Name the defect of vision he is suffering from.
**(ii)** Which lens is used for the correction of this defect?
**(iii)** List two main causes of developing this defect.
**(iv)** Compute the power of this lens.

**Solution:**

**(i) Defect:** **Myopia** (Near-sightedness). Negative focal length indicates a concave lens, which is used for myopia.
**(ii) Lens:** **Concave lens** (Diverging lens).
**(iii) Causes:**
  1. Elongation of the eyeball.
  2. Excessive curvature of the eye lens.
**(iv) Power:**
  - $f = -2.5$ m
  - $P = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-2.5} = \mathbf{-0.4 \text{ D}}$

---

## Question 20

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:** 
**(a)** A person is suffering from both myopia and hypermetropia.
**(i)** What kind of lenses can correct this defect?
**(ii)** How are these lenses prepared?
**(b)** A person needs a lens of power + 3D for correcting his near vision and – 3D for correcting his distant vision. Calculate the focal lengths of the lenses required to correct these defects.

**Solution:**

**(a) Presbyopia (Dual defect):**
**(i) Type of lens:** **Bifocal lenses**.
**(ii) Preparation:** A bifocal lens consists of two parts:
- The **upper part** is a **concave lens** for distant vision.
- The **lower part** is a **convex lens** for near vision.

**(b) Focal length calculation:**
- **For Near Vision ($P = +3$ D):**
  - $f_1 = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{+3} \approx +0.333$ m $= \mathbf{+33.3 \text{ cm}}$
- **For Distant Vision ($P = -3$ D):**
  - $f_2 = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{-3} \approx -0.333$ m $= \mathbf{-33.3 \text{ cm}}$

## Question 21

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:** 
**(a)** Write the help of labeled ray diagram, show the path followed by a narrow beam of monochromatic light when it passes through a glass prism.
**(b)** What would happen it this beam is replaced by a narrow beam of white light?

**Solution:**

**(a) Monochromatic light through prism:**
Monochromatic light (light of a single color/wavelength) will undergo refraction at both faces of the prism and emerge deviated from its original path. It will **not** undergo dispersion.

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing incident ray, refracted ray, emergent ray, and angle of deviation ($\delta$).

**(b) Replacement with white light:**
If the monochromatic beam is replaced by white light:
1. The white light will undergo **dispersion**.
2. It will split into its seven constituent colors (VIBGYOR).
3. This happens because different colors travel at different speeds in glass and bend by different angles. Violet will bend the most and red the least.

---

## Question 22

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2021</span>

**Question:** In the diagram given below, $X$ and $Y$ are the end colours of the spectrum of white light. The colour of $Y$ represents the
**(1)** Colour of sky as seen from earth during the day
**(2)** Colour of the sky as seen from the moon
**(3)** Colour used to paint the danger signals
**(4)** Colour of sun at the time of noon.

**Solution:**

**Answer: (3) Colour used to paint the danger signals**

**Explanation:** In a typical prism dispersion diagram, $X$ is usually violet (top/most deviated) and $Y$ is red (bottom/least deviated). Since red has the longest wavelength and is scattered the least by fog or smoke, it is used for danger signals.

---

## Question 23

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2021</span>

**Question:** Which one of the following is the correct reason for twinkling of stars?
**(1)** Atmospheric reflection of starlight
**(2)** Atmospheric refraction of starlight
**(3)** Scattering of starlight
**(4)** Dispersion of starlight

**Solution:**

**Answer: (2) Atmospheric refraction of starlight**

**Explanation:** Twinkling is caused by the continuous change in the path and intensity of starlight as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere with varying refractive indices.

---

## Question 24

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** It is observed that the power of an eye to see nearby objects as well as far off objects diminishes with age.
**(i)** Give reason for the above statement.
**(ii)** Name the defect that is likely to arise in the eyes in such a condition.

**Solution:**

**(i) Reason:**
With age, the **ciliary muscles weaken** and the **flexibility of the crystalline lens decreases**. This makes it difficult for the eye to change its focal length effectively to focus on objects at various distances.

**(ii) Defect:** **Presbyopia**.

---

## Question 25

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** A person cannot see distinctly the object placed beyond 5 m from his eyes. Name the defect of vision the person is suffering from. Draw a ray diagram to illustrate this defect. List its two possible causes. Name the lens used for the correction of this defect.

**Solution:**

- **Defect:** **Myopia** (Near-sightedness). The person cannot see objects beyond 5 m (far point has come closer).
- **Ray diagram for defect:**
  > **TODO:** Add diagram showing parallel rays from infinity focusing in front of the retina.
- **Causes:**
  1. Elongation of the eyeball.
  2. Excessive curvature of the eye lens.
- **Corrective Lens:** **Concave (diverging) lens** of suitable focal length.

## Question 26

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** The lens system of human eye forms an image on a light sensitive screen, which is called as:
**(1)** Cornea  
**(2)** Ciliary muscles  
**(3)** Optic nerves  
**(4)** Retina

**Solution:**

**Answer: (4) Retina**

**Explanation:** The retina is the light-sensitive inner lining of the eye where images are formed.

---

## Question 27

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** 
**Assertion:** The rainbow is a natural spectrum of sunlight in the sky.
**Reason:** Rainbow is formed in the sky when the sun is behind us and water droplets are also present in air.
**(1)** A  
**(2)** B  
**(3)** C  
**(4)** D

**Solution:**

**Answer: (1) A**

**Explanation:** Both assertion and reason are true, and the reason correctly explains the condition for observing a rainbow. A rainbow is indeed a natural spectrum, and it is observed when the observer is between the sun and the rain (sun behind).

---

## Question 28

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** Study the diagram given below and answer the questions that follow:
**(i)** Name the defect of vision represented in the diagram. Give reason for your answer.
**(ii)** List two causes of this defect.
**(iii)** With the help of a diagram show how this defect of vision is corrected.

**Solution:**

*(Assuming the diagram shows rays focusing in front of the retina)*

**(i) Defect:** **Myopia**.
- **Reason:** The light rays from a distant object are converging at a point **in front of the retina** instead of on it.

**(ii) Causes:**
1. Elongation of the eyeball.
2. Excessive curvature of the eye lens.

**(iii) Correction Diagram:**
> **TODO:** Add diagram showing a concave lens diverging rays before they enter the eye, allowing them to focus on the retina.

---

## Question 29

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** A narrow beam, PQ of white light is passing through a glass prism ABC as shown in the diagram. Draw a ray diagram to show the emergence of colours as it falls on the screen DE. Also write the phenomenon involved and its cause. Using second law of refraction state which colour must have the highest value of refractive index amongst seven visible colours of light. Justify your answer.

**Solution:**

**Ray Diagram:**
> **TODO:** Add diagram of white light PQ entering prism ABC and emerging as a spectrum (VIBGYOR) on screen DE.

**Phenomenon:** **Dispersion of white light**.

**Cause:** Different constituent colors of white light travel at different speeds in glass. Therefore, each color undergoes a different amount of bending (refraction) when passing through the prism.

**Refractive Index ($\mu$) and Refraction:**
- According to **Snell's Law** (Second law of refraction): $n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$.
- The amount of deviation ($\delta$) is directly related to the refractive index.
- **Violet** light bends the most, meaning its angle of refraction ($r$) inside the prism is the smallest for a given angle of incidence.
- Therefore, **Violet** must have the **highest value of refractive index**.
- **Justification:** $\mu$ is inversely proportional to wavelength ($\lambda$). Since violet has the shortest wavelength, it has the highest refractive index and undergoes the maximum deviation.

---

## Question 30

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** Consider the following statements in the case of human eye:
**(a)** The diameter of the eye ball is about 2.3 cm.
**(b)** Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.
**(c)** Most of the refraction for the light rays entering the eye occurs at the crystalline lens.
**(d)** While focusing on the objects at different distances the distance between the crystalline lens and the retina is adjusted by ciliary muscles.
The correct statements are
**(1)** (a) and (b)
**(2)** (a), (b) and (c)
**(3)** (b), (c) and (d)
**(4)** (a), (c) and (d)

**Solution:**

**Answer: (1) (a) and (b)**

**Explanation:**
- (a) is true: Eyeball diameter is ~2.3 cm.
- (b) is true: Iris controls pupil size.
- (c) is false: Most refraction occurs at the **outer surface of the cornea**.
- (d) is false: The distance between lens and retina is **fixed**. The **focal length** is adjusted, not the distance.

## Question 31

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** 
**(a)** A person suffering from an eye defect uses lenses of power -1 D. Name the defect of vision and list its two causes. State the nature (converging/diverging) of the corrective lens.
**(b)** What is presbyopia? Name the type of lens used for the correction of this defect. State the nature (converging/diverging) of the lens which forms part of such lenses.

**Solution:**

**(a) Myopia:**
- **Defect:** **Myopia** (Near-sightedness). Negative power (-1 D) indicates a concave lens.
- **Causes:**
  1. Elongation of the eyeball.
  2. Excessive curvature of the eye lens.
- **Nature of Lens:** **Diverging lens** (Concave lens).

**(b) Presbyopia:**
- **Definition:** The gradual loss of the eye's ability to focus on nearby objects due to aging is called presbyopia.
- **Corrective Lens:** **Bifocal lenses**.
- **Nature of parts:**
  - The **upper part** is a **diverging lens** (concave) for distant vision.
  - The **lower part** is a **converging lens** (convex) for near vision.

## Question 32

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2024</span>

**Question:** Define the term power of accommodation in human eye. What happens to the image distance from the eye when we increase the distance of an object from the eye? Name and explain the role of the part of human eye responsible for it in this case.

**Solution:**

**Power of Accommodation:** It is the ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length, so as to form a clear image of both nearby and distant objects on the retina.

**Effect on Image Distance:**
- The **image distance remains constant** (approximately 2.3 cm, which is the fixed distance between the lens and the retina).

**Responsible Part:** **Ciliary Muscles**.
- **Role:** When the object distance increases (distant object):
  1. The ciliary muscles **relax**.
  2. The eye lens becomes **thinner** (less curved).
  3. The **focal length increases**.
  4. This allows the parallel rays from the distant object to focus exactly on the retina.
