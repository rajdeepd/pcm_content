# Section B: Board Previous Year Questions - Solutions

## Question 1

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2012</span>

**Question:** How does the thickness of the eye lens change when we shift looking from a distant tree to reading a book?

**Solution:**

When we shift from looking at a distant tree to reading a book:

- **For distant object (tree):** The ciliary muscles are **relaxed**, making the eye lens **thinner** (less convex). This increases the focal length.

- **For near object (book):** The ciliary muscles **contract**, making the eye lens **thicker** (more convex). This decreases the focal length.

**Answer:** The thickness of the eye lens **increases** (becomes thicker) when we shift from looking at a distant tree to reading a book.

## Question 2

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2014</span>

**Question:**

**(i)** List the parts of the human eye that control the amount of light entering into it. Explain, how they performs this function?

**(ii)** Write the function of retina in human eye.

**(iii)** Do you know that the corneal-impairment can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of the donated eye? How and why should we organise groups to motivate the community members to donate their eyes after death?

**Solution:**

**(i) Parts controlling light entry:**

**Parts:** **Iris** and **Pupil**

**How they function:**
- **Iris:** It is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil.
- **Pupil:** It is the opening in the iris through which light enters.
- In **bright light:** Iris contracts → Pupil becomes smaller → Less light enters
- In **dim light:** Iris expands → Pupil becomes larger → More light enters

**(ii) Function of retina:**

The retina is the light-sensitive screen at the back of the eye where:
- The image is formed by the eye lens
- It contains light-sensitive cells (rods and cones)
- These cells generate electrical signals when light falls on them
- These signals are sent to the brain through optic nerves
- The brain interprets these signals and we perceive the image

**(iii) Eye donation and community motivation:**

**Corneal transplant:** The defective cornea can be replaced with a healthy cornea from a donated eye, restoring vision.

**How to motivate:**
1. **Awareness campaigns:** Organize talks and seminars in schools, colleges, and communities
2. **Success stories:** Share inspiring stories of people who regained sight through corneal transplant
3. **Pledge drives:** Encourage people to pledge their eyes
4. **Information dissemination:** Distribute pamphlets and posters about eye donation
5. **Collaboration:** Work with eye banks and hospitals
6. **Religious/social leaders:** Involve them to spread the message

**Why it's important:**
- Corneal blindness can be cured through donation
- One person can give vision to two people
- Eye donation doesn't disfigure the face
- It's the greatest gift one can give
- Creates awareness about organ donation

## Question 3

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2015</span>

**Question:** State one main function each of iris, pupil, and cornea.

**Solution:**

| Part | Main Function |
|------|---------------|
| **Iris** | Controls the size of the pupil and thus regulates the amount of light entering the eye |
| **Pupil** | Allows light to enter the eye (acts as an opening/aperture) |
| **Cornea** | Refracts (bends) most of the light entering the eye and protects the eye |

## Question 4

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2015</span>

**Question:** Mention the factor on which scattering of light depends. Explain, why the colour of the clear sky is blue? An astronaut in space finds sky to be dark. Explain reason for this observation.

**Solution:**

**Factor on which scattering depends:**

Scattering of light depends on the **wavelength of light** (or **size of particles** relative to wavelength).

According to **Rayleigh's scattering law:**
$$\text{Scattering} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light.

**Why is the sky blue?**

1. Sunlight consists of seven colors (VIBGYOR) with different wavelengths
2. Blue light has a **shorter wavelength** compared to red light
3. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, it encounters air molecules and dust particles
4. Blue light is **scattered much more** than red light (because scattering ∝ 1/λ⁴)
5. When we look at the sky, we see this scattered blue light coming from all directions
6. Therefore, the sky appears **blue**

**Why does an astronaut see a dark sky?**

1. In space, there is **no atmosphere** (no air molecules)
2. Without particles to scatter sunlight, **no scattering occurs**
3. Only direct sunlight from the sun is visible
4. The sky appears **black/dark** because there are no scattered light rays reaching the astronaut's eyes

## Question 5

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2016</span>

**Question:** What is atmospheric refraction? Use this phenomenon to explain the following natural events.

**(i)** Twinkling of stars  
**(ii)** Advantages sunrise and delayed sunset.

Draw diagrams to illustrate your answers.

**Solution:**

**Atmospheric Refraction:**

Atmospheric refraction is the phenomenon of bending of light rays as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere having layers of different optical densities (due to different temperatures and densities).

**(i) Twinkling of stars:**

**Explanation:**
1. Stars are very far away and act as point sources of light
2. Light from stars passes through different layers of atmosphere with varying densities
3. Due to atmospheric refraction, the path of light changes continuously
4. The **apparent position** of the star changes slightly
5. The amount of light reaching our eyes also changes
6. This causes the star to appear brighter or dimmer alternately
7. This is called **twinkling**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing star light passing through atmospheric layers

**Why don't planets twinkle?**
- Planets are closer and appear as extended sources
- Light comes from many points, and changes average out

**(ii) Advanced sunrise and delayed sunset:**

**Explanation:**

**Advanced Sunrise:**
1. Before actual sunrise, the sun is below the horizon
2. Light from the sun enters the atmosphere and gets refracted
3. Due to atmospheric refraction, light bends towards the normal
4. The sun appears to be **above the horizon** even when it's actually below
5. We see the sun about **2 minutes earlier** than actual sunrise

**Delayed Sunset:**
1. After actual sunset, the sun goes below the horizon
2. But due to atmospheric refraction, we still see the sun for some time
3. The sun appears to be **above the horizon** even when it's actually below
4. We see the sun about **2 minutes later** than actual sunset

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing atmospheric refraction at sunrise/sunset

**Net effect:** Day is longer by about **4 minutes** (2 min for sunrise + 2 min for sunset)
