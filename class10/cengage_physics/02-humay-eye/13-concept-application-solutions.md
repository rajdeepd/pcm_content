## Exercise 1 Solutions {#exercise-1}

### Solution 1

**Question:** A person needs a lens of power -5.5 diopters for correcting his distant vision. For correcting his near vision, he needs a lens of power +1.5 diopters. What is the focal length of the lens required for correcting (i) Distant vision, (ii) Near vision?

**Given:**
- Power for distant vision: \\(P_1 = -5.5\\) D
- Power for near vision: \\(P_2 = +1.5\\) D

**Solution:**

**(i) For distant vision:**

$$P_1 = \frac{1}{f_1} \Rightarrow f_1 = \frac{1}{P_1} = \frac{1}{-5.5} \text{ m}$$

$$f_1 = \frac{1}{-5.5} \times 100 = -18.18 \text{ cm}$$

**(ii) For near vision:**

$$P_2 = \frac{1}{f_2} \Rightarrow f_2 = \frac{1}{P_2} = \frac{1}{1.5} \text{ m}$$

$$f_2 = \frac{1}{1.5} \times 100 = 66.6 \text{ cm}$$

**Answer:** (3) -18.18 cm, 66.6 cm

### Solution 2

**Question:** To correct myopic defect, the focal length of the concave lens should be

**Solution:**

To correct myopic defect, a concave lens is used. The purpose of this lens is to make the image of distant object (at infinity) form at the far point of the myopic eye.

For object at infinity: \\(u = -\infty\\)

Image should form at far point: \\(v = -F\\) (where F is the far point distance)

Using lens formula: \\(\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}\\)

$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-F} - \frac{1}{-\infty} = \frac{1}{-F}$$

Therefore, \\(f = -F\\)

The magnitude of focal length equals the distance of far point.

**Answer:** (1) Equal to the distance of far point

### Solution 3

**Question:** A far sighted person cannot focus clearly on object that are less than 145 cm from his eyes. To correct this problem, the person wear eyeglass that are located 2 cm in front of his eyes. Determine the focal length of lens that will permit this person to read a newspaper at a distance of 32.0 cm from his eyes.

**Given:**
- Near point of person = 145 cm from eyes
- Distance of eyeglass from eyes = 2 cm
- Reading distance = 32.0 cm from eyes

**Solution:**

Distance of newspaper from lens: \\(u = -(32 - 2) = -30\\) cm

The image should form at the near point of the person (without glasses), which is at 145 cm from eyes.

Distance of image from lens: \\(v = -(145 - 2) = -143\\) cm

Using lens formula: \\(\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}\\)

$$\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{-143} - \frac{1}{-30}$$

$$\frac{1}{f} = -\frac{1}{143} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{-30 + 143}{143 \times 30} = \frac{113}{4290}$$

$$f = \frac{4290}{113} \approx 38 \text{ cm}$$

**Answer:** (1) 38 cm

### Solution 4

**Question:** The change in the focal length of the eye lens is caused by the action of the ______.

**Solution:** The ciliary muscles alter the curvature of the eye lens, thus changing its focal length. This allows the eye to focus on objects at different distances (power of accommodation).

**Answer:** (3) Ciliary muscles

---

### Solution 5

**Question:** The least distance of distinct vision for an adult man/woman is ______.

**Solution:** The least distance of distinct vision is the minimum distance at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain. For a normal adult eye, this distance is about 25 cm, which is also called the near point.

**Answer:** (1) 25 cm

---

### Solution 6

**Question:** The human eye can focus objects at different distances by adjusting the focal length of the eye lens. This is known as

**Solution:** The ability of the eye lens to change its focal length to focus on objects at different distances is called the power of accommodation. This is achieved by the ciliary muscles changing the curvature of the lens.

**Answer:** (2) Accommodation

### Solution 7

**Question:** Hypermetropia is the defect of vision due to which a person finds difficulty in seeing the

**Solution:** Hypermetropia (or far-sightedness) is a defect where the person can see distant objects clearly but has difficulty seeing nearby objects clearly. The image of nearby objects forms behind the retina instead of on it.

**Answer:** (2) Nearby objects

---

### Solution 8

**Question:** A person is suffering from the defect of astigmatism, its main reason is

**Solution:** Astigmatism occurs due to the irregular shape of the cornea or the imperfect spherical nature of the eye lens. This causes the focal length of the eye lens in two perpendicular directions to become different, resulting in blurred vision.

**Answer:** (3) Irregular shape of cornea or the imperfect spherical nature of the eye lens
