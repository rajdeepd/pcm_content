# Chapter 02: Human Eye and Colourful World

## Chapter Overview

### Introduction

All of us have experienced how difficult it becomes when there is complete darkness and nothing can be seen. We are not talking about a scary movie here but we are talking about vision which is facilitated by our eyes.

We know **EYES** makes it possible to see all the beautiful things around us, but ever wondered how? Why do some of you or your friends needs spectacles to see the black board in the class room or to read the book? Why do we squint when someone suddenly flashes a strong light in our face? How do things look bigger when we look under a plane glass like magnifying lens? Or how do we see various colors coming out of a pyramid shaped object called prism?

In this chapter, we explore the fascinating world of the human eye as an optical instrument and its pivotal role in perceiving the colorful spectrum of light. We begin by dissecting the eye's structure, including the cornea, iris, lens, and retina, unraveling their functions in focusing light and forming images. The working of the eye is explained, shedding light on the phenomena of refraction and the formation of image on the retina, as well as common vision defects like myopia and hypermetropia. We will delve into the perception of color, discussing the concept of primary colors, the dispersion of light through prisms, and the interplay between colors and wavelengths. Additionally, we examine atmospheric refraction's influence on phenomena like sunrise and sunset. By the chapter's end, students will have a profound understanding of the human eye's complexity and its connection to the vibrant, colorful world they perceive daily. Practical applications, such as corrective lenses and optical instruments, underscore the real-world significance of this knowledge.
