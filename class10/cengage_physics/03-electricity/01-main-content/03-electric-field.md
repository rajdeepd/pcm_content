# 03. Electric Field

## 3. ELECTRIC FIELD

**Electric field** due to a given charge is defined as the space around the charge in which electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion due to charge can be experienced by any other charge. If a test charge experiences no force at a point, the electric field at that point must be zero.

**Electric field intensity** at any point is the strength of electric field at that point. It is defined as the force experienced by unit positive charge placed at that point.

**Formula:** If $F$ is the force acting on a test charge $+q_0$ at any point, then electric field intensity at this point is given by

$$
E = \frac{F}{q_0}
$$

**Nature of Electric Field:** Electric field is a vector quantity.

**SI unit:** Since force is measured in newton and charge is measured in coulomb (C), electric field intensity is measured in newton per coulomb (N/C).
