# Electric Current - Worked Examples

## Example 15

**Problem:** If $q$ coulombs of charge travels through a conductor of length $l$ metre with a velocity of $v$ metre/sec, find the current flowing through the conductor.

**Solution:**

Charge passing through the conductor $= q$ coulomb

We know that current, $i = \frac{q}{t}$ --- (i)

Also, speed (velocity), $v = \frac{l}{t}$
$$\Rightarrow t = \frac{l}{v}$$

Substituting the value of $t$ in Eq. (i), we get:
$$i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{q}{(l/v)} = \frac{q \times v}{l}$$

**Answer:** The current flowing through the conductor is $\frac{qv}{l}$.

## Example 16

**Problem:** An electron of charge $e$ coulomb moves in a circular orbit at a frequency of $n$ revolutions per second. Find the strength of the current.

**Solution:**

Let $P$ be a reference point in the orbit.
In 1 second, the electron completes $n$ revolutions.

Current $i$ is the rate of flow of charge:
$$i = \frac{q}{t}$$

In 1 second, the electron passes through point $P$ for $n$ times.
Therefore, total charge through $P$ in 1 second $(q) = n \times e$ (where $e$ is the charge of an electron).

Consider $t = 1 \text{ s}$:
$$\therefore i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{ne}{1} = ne \text{ (ampere)}$$

**Answer:** The strength of the current is $ne$ A.

## Example 17

**Problem:** If a million electrons travel through a conductor in $1 \mu\text{s}$, how many nanoamperes of current are flowing?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Number of electrons, $n = 1 \text{ million} = 10^6$ electrons
- Time, $t = 1 \mu\text{s} = 10^{-6} \text{ s}$
- Charge of 1 electron, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

**Conversion factors:**
- $10^{-9} \text{ A} = 1 \text{ nA}$
- $1 \text{ A} = 10^9 \text{ nA}$

We know that current, $i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{ne}{t}$ --- (i)

Substituting the values:
$$i = \frac{10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{10^{-6}}$$
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ A}$$

Now, convert to nanoamperes (nA):
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} \times 10^9 \text{ nA}$$
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^2 \text{ nA} = 160 \text{ nA}$$

**Answer:** The current flowing is 160 nA.
