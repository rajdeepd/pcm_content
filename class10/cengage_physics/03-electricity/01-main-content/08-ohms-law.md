# 08. Ohm's Law

## Statement

If the physical conditions remain unchanged (such as temperature), the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is directly proportional to the electric current flowing through it.

$$V \propto I$$

$$V = RI$$

where $R$ is the constant of proportionality and is called the resistance of the conductor.

---

## Definition of Resistance

It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it.

By definition, the ratio $\frac{V}{I}$ is the electric resistance $R$ of the conductor.

$$R = \frac{V}{I} = \text{constant}$$

**Properties:**
* The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω).
* The resistance of a conductor of uniform thickness depends on the length of the conductor ($l$) and the area of cross section ($A$).

**V-I Graph:** The V-I graph is a straight line that passes through the origin O of the graph, indicating direct proportionality between voltage and current.

## Resistance and Resistivity

**Proportionality Relations:**
* $R \propto$ Length of conductor $\Rightarrow R \propto l$
* $R \propto \frac{1}{\text{Area of cross-section of the conductor}} \Rightarrow R \propto \frac{1}{A}$

**Combined Formula:**

$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$

where $\rho$ (constant of proportionality) is called the specific resistance or resistivity of the conductor. It depends on the nature of the material of the substance, not on its shape and size.

## 8.1 Definition of Resistivity

**(i) Definition:** It is defined as the resistance offered by a wire of the material of unit length and unit cross-sectional area. We can also define resistivity as the resistance of a unit meter cube of that material.

**SI Unit:** ohm-meter (Ω-m)

## ACTIVITY 1: VERIFICATION OF OHM'S LAW

**Objective:** To study relationship between the potential difference across a conductor and the current through

**Procedure:**
1. Set up a circuit consisting of a nichrome wire XY of length say 0.5 m, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and four cells of 1.5 V each. (Nichrome is an alloy of nickel, chromium, manganese, and iron metals.)
2. First use only one cell as the source in the circuit.
3. Note the reading in the ammeter for the current (I) and reading of the voltmeter for the potential difference (V) across the nichrome wire XY in the circuit.
4. Next connect two cells in the circuit and note the respective readings of the ammeter and voltmeter.
5. Repeat the above steps using three cells and then four cells in the circuit separately.
6. Calculate the ratio of V to I for each pair of potential difference V and current I.
7. Plot a graph between V and I, and observe the nature of the graph.

## ACTIVITY 2: CURRENT FOR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS

**Objective:** To study that current is different for different components

**Materials:** Nichrome wire, torch bulb, 10-W bulb, ammeter (0-5 A range), plug key, connecting wires, four dry cells of 1.5 V each

**Procedure:**
1. Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter, leaving a gap in the circuit.
2. Complete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY. Plug the key. Note down the ammeter reading. Take out the key from the plug. [Note: Always take out the key from the plug before making changes to the circuit.]
3. Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through it by measuring the reading of the ammeter.
4. Now repeat the above step with the 10-W bulb in the gap XY.
5. Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY? What do your observations indicate?
6. You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the ammeter readings in each case. Analyze the observations.

**Result:** We observe that current is different for different components.

## ACTIVITY 3: FACTORS AFFECTING RESISTANCE

**Objective:** To study the factors on which resistance of a conductor depends

**Procedure:**
1. Complete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length $l$ [say, marked (1)] and a plug key.
2. Now, plug the key. Note the current in the ammeter.
3. Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the length, that is, $2l$.
4. Note the ammeter reading.
5. Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire of the same length $l$. A thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again, note down the current through the circuit.
6. Instead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire in the circuit. Let the length and cross-sectional area of the wire be same as that of the first nichrome wire. Note the value of the current.
7. Notice the difference in the current in all cases.

**Questions:**
* Does the current depend on the length of the conductor?
* Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?

**Result:** We observe that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when the length of the wire is doubled and vice versa.

## Conductivity and Conductance

* The reciprocal of resistivity is called **conductivity**.
* Conductivity (or specific conductance) measures a material's ability to conduct electric current.
* The reciprocal of resistance is called **conductance**.
* Conductance = $\frac{1}{\text{Resistance}}$
* $\sigma = \frac{1}{R}$
* Conductance is represented by $\sigma$ (sigma) and its unit is mho or (ohm)$^{-1}$.

## Variation of Resistance with Dimensions

When a conductor's dimensions change while its volume remains constant (e.g., stretching a wire):

**Volume Conservation:** $A_1L_1 = A_2L_2$ or $A_2 = \frac{A_1L_1}{L_2}$ ...(i)

**Initial Resistance:** $R = \frac{\rho L_1}{A_1}$

**New Resistance:** $R' = \frac{\rho L_2}{A_2}$ ...(ii)

Substituting $A_2$ from (i) into (ii):

$$R' = \frac{\rho L_2^2}{A_1L_1} = \frac{\rho L_1}{A_1} \times \left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^2 = R \times \left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^2$$

**Summary of Resistance Changes:**

* **(i) Change in Length:** If the length of a conductor of resistance $R$ is changed from $L_1$ to $L_2$, its new resistance becomes $\left(\frac{L_2}{L_1}\right)^2 R$.

* **(ii) Change in Cross-sectional Area:** If the area of cross-section of a given conductor of resistance $R$ is changed from $A_1$ to $A_2$, its new resistance becomes $\left(\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right)^2 \times R$.

* **(iii) Change in Radius:** If the radius of a given conductor wire of resistance $R$ is changed from $r_1$ to $r_2$, its new resistance becomes $\left(\frac{r_1}{r_2}\right)^4 R$.

* **(iv) Resistance vs. Resistivity:** Resistance of a material changes with its shape and size, but its resistivity remains the same. Resistivity is different for different materials.

* **(v) Temperature Dependence:** For a conductor, both resistance and resistivity increase with an increase in temperature.

**Resistivity Comparison:** At a particular temperature, the resistivity of various substances is related as:

$$\rho_{\text{insulators}} > \rho_{\text{semiconductor}} > \rho_{\text{alloys}} > \rho_{\text{metals}}$$

## Range of Resistivities

* **For conductors:** $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ Ωm
* **For insulators:** $10^8$ to $10^{16}$ Ωm (very large)
* **For semiconductors:** $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-2}$ Ωm
* **For alloys:** $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ Ωm

**Conductivity:** Silver > Copper > Gold > Aluminum

**Conductor Types:**

## INSIGHTS

**Semiconductors:** Substances having conductivity lower than conductors but greater than insulators. Examples: silicon, germanium. Semiconductors do not obey Ohm's law, meaning their V-I graph is not a straight line.

**Superconductivity:** A phenomenon observed in several metals and ceramic materials when cooled to a critical temperature ($T_c$) at which their electrical resistance becomes zero.

**Human Body Resistance:** Although the human body has a large resistance of the order of kilo-Ohms (kΩ), it is very sensitive to minute currents as low as a few milliamps (mA). Such currents can cause electrocution by disrupting the nervous system of the body, leading to a loss of control over bodily functions.

## Examples

### Example 10

**Problem:** The potential difference in an electric circuit is 16 V, and the current value is 8 A, respectively. Using the formula, find the resistance of the circuit.

**Solution:**

To find the resistance ($R$) of the circuit:

**Given:** $V = 16$ V, $I = 8$ A

Using Ohm's law formula:

$$R = \frac{V}{I} \Rightarrow R = \frac{16}{8} \Rightarrow R = 2 \Omega$$

**Answer:** The resistance of the circuit is 2 Ω.

---

### Example 11

**Problem:** Calculate the current through the circuit in which the voltage and resistance are 15 V and 3 Ω, respectively?

**Solution:**

**Given:** $V = 15$ V, $R = 3 \Omega$

The equation for current using Ohm's law is:

$$I = \frac{V}{R} \Rightarrow I = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ A}$$

**Answer:** The current through the circuit is 5 A.

---

### Example 12

**Problem:** A current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of electric bulb for 60 s. The amount of electric charge that flows through the circuit is

(1) 30.0 C  
(2) 300 C  
(3) 3.00 C  
(4) 30.0 μC

**Solution:**

**Given:** $I = 0.5$ A, $t = 60$ s

Using the formula: $I = \frac{Q}{t}$

$$0.5 = \frac{Q}{60} \Rightarrow Q = 30 \text{ C}$$

**Answer: (1) 30.0 C**

---

### Example 13

**Problem:** The specific resistance of nichrome is 100 mΩ-cm. What will be the resistance of a nichrome wire of 5 m length and 0.01 cm² area of cross-section?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* $\rho = 100$ mΩ-cm
* $l = 5$ m $= 500$ cm
* $A = 0.01$ cm²

Using the formula: $R = \rho\left(\frac{l}{A}\right)$

$$R = 100 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{-2} \times \frac{5}{10^{-6}} = 5000 \Omega$$

**Answer:** The resistance of the nichrome wire is 5000 Ω.

---

### Example 14

**Problem:** An electric bulb is connected in an electric circuit. If 10 C charge flows through this bulb in 5 s. Find the current flowing through the bulb.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Charge, $Q = 10$ C
* Time taken, $t = 5$ s

**Current:**

$$I = \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ A}$$

**Answer:** The current flowing through the bulb is 2 A.

---

### Example 15

**Problem:** If $q$ coulombs of charge travels through a conductor of length $l$ metre with a velocity of $v$ metre/second, then what is the current flowing through the conductor?

**Solution:**

Charge passing through the conductor $= q$ coulomb  
We know that current, $i = \frac{q}{t}$ --- (i)

And Speed, $v = \frac{l}{t}$
$$\Rightarrow t = \frac{l}{v}$$

Substituting the value of $t$ in Eq. (i), we get:
$$i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{q}{(l/v)} = \frac{q \times v}{l}$$

**Answer:** The current flowing through the conductor is $\frac{qv}{l}$.

---

### Example 16

**Problem:** An electron of charge $e$ coulomb moves in a circular orbit at a frequency of $n$ revolutions per second. Find the strength of the current.

**Solution:**

Let $P$ = Reference point in the orbit.  
Current $i = \text{Rate of flow of charge} = \frac{q}{t}$

In 1 second, the electron completes $n$ revolutions. ($\because$ frequency is $n$)  
In 1 second, the electron passes through point $P$ for $n$ times.  
Therefore, charge through $P$ in 1 second $(q) = n \times e$, where $e$ is the charge of an electron.

Consider $t = 1 \text{ s}$:
$$\therefore i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{ne}{1} = ne \text{ (ampere)}$$

**Answer:** The strength of the current is $ne$ A.

---

### Example 17

**Problem:** If a million electrons travel through a conductor in $1 \mu\text{s}$, how many nanoamperes of current are flowing?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Number of electrons, $n = 1 \text{ million} = 10^6$ electrons
* Time, $t = 1 \mu\text{s} = 10^{-6} \text{ s}$
* Charge of 1 electron, $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

**Conversion Factors:**
* We know that $10^{-9} \text{ A} = 1 \text{ nA}$
* $1 \text{ A} = \frac{1}{10^{-9}} \text{ nA} = 10^9 \text{ nA}$

We know that current, $i = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{ne}{t}$ --- (i)

Substituting the values:
$$i = \frac{10^6 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{10^{-6}}$$
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ C/s} = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} \text{ A}$$

Now converting to nanoamperes (nA):
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^{-7} \times 10^9 \text{ nA}$$
$$i = 1.6 \times 10^2 \text{ nA} = 160 \text{ nA}$$

**Answer:** The current flowing is 160 nA.

### Example 18

**Problem:** We stretch a wire of resistance $R$ such that its length increases by 20%. Then the percentage change in its resistance will be

(1) 20%  
(2) 44%  
(3) 10%  
(4) 40%

**Solution:**

**Given:** Original length = $L$, New length = $1.2L$ (20% increase)

For a wire stretched without changing its volume:

$$\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \left(\frac{\ell_1}{\ell_2}\right)^2$$

Substituting $\ell_2 = 1.2L$:

$$\frac{R}{R_2} = \left(\frac{L}{1.2L}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{1.44}$$

Therefore: $R_2 = 1.44R$

**Percentage change:**

$$\frac{R_2 - R_1}{R_1} \times 100 = \frac{1.44R - R}{R} \times 100 = 44\%$$

**Answer: (2) 44%**

---

### Example 19

**Problem:** If a wire of resistance 'R' is stretched twice its original length, keeping volume constant, then what will be its new resistance? (Let new resistance be R')

(1) 2R  
(2) R/2  
(3) R/3  
(4) 4R

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Original length = $L$, New length = $2L$
* Volume is constant

**Volume Conservation:** Volume = Length × Cross-sectional area

Original: Volume = $L \times A$  
New: Volume = $2L \times A'$

Since volume is constant: $LA = 2LA' \Rightarrow A' = \frac{A}{2}$

**Original Resistance:** $R = \rho\frac{L}{A}$

**New Resistance:**

$$R' = \rho\frac{\text{Length}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{new}}} = \rho\frac{2L}{A/2} = \rho\frac{4L}{A}$$

Substituting $R = \rho\frac{L}{A}$:

$$R' = 4\left(\rho\frac{L}{A}\right) = 4R$$

**Answer: (4) 4R**

The new resistance ($R'$) of the stretched wire is 4 times the value of resistance of the unstretched wire ($R$).
