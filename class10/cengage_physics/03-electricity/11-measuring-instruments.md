# 11. Common Measuring Instruments

## 11.1 Ammeter

An **ammeter** is used for measurement of electric current in a circuit.

- Always connected in series.
- The ideal ammeter has zero resistance.

## 11.2 Voltmeter

A **voltmeter** is used for measurement of potential difference between two points in an electric circuit.

- Always connected in parallel to the ends of the conductor.
- The ideal voltmeter has infinite resistance.

## 11.3 General Characteristics

We have seen these meters in voltage stabilizers. In these meters, a needle moving over a graduated scale gives the value of the measured quantity. Each meter has two terminals. The terminal marked '+' is connected to the higher potential side of a circuit, while the terminal marked '-' is connected to the lower potential side.
