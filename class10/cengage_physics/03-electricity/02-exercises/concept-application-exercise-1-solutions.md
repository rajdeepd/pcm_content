## Problem 1

**Question:** If force between two charged objects is to be left unchanged even though the charge on one of the objects is halved, keeping the other the same, then the original distance of separation $d$ should be

**Solution:**

From Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{kq_1 q_2}{d^2}$

Let the original charges be $q_1$ and $q_2$, and original distance be $d$.

Original force: $F = \frac{kq_1 q_2}{d^2}$

After halving one charge: New force $F' = \frac{k(q_1/2) q_2}{d'^2}$

For forces to be equal: $\frac{kq_1 q_2}{d^2} = \frac{k(q_1/2) q_2}{d'^2}$

Simplifying: $\frac{1}{d^2} = \frac{1/2}{d'^2}$

Therefore: $d'^2 = \frac{d^2}{2}$

So: $d' = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}$

**Answer: (2) $d/\sqrt{2}$**

## Problem 2

**Question:** If a unit charge is taken from one point to another over an equipotential surface, then

**Solution:**

An equipotential surface is a surface where all points have the same electric potential. The work done in moving a charge between two points on an equipotential surface is given by:

$W = q(V_B - V_A)$

Since $V_A = V_B$ (same potential on equipotential surface), we get:

$W = q(0) = 0$

**Answer: (4) No work is done**

## Problem 3

**Question:** Two point charges +2 C and +6 C repel each other with a force of 12 N. If a charge of -4 C is given to each of these charges, then the force now is

**Solution:**

Original charges: $q_1 = +2$ C, $q_2 = +6$ C

Original force: $F = 12$ N (repulsive)

From Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{kq_1 q_2}{r^2} = \frac{k(2)(6)}{r^2} = \frac{12k}{r^2} = 12$ N

Therefore: $\frac{k}{r^2} = 1$

After adding -4 C to each charge:
- New $q_1 = +2 + (-4) = -2$ C
- New $q_2 = +6 + (-4) = +2$ C

New force: $F' = \frac{k(-2)(+2)}{r^2} = \frac{-4k}{r^2} = -4(1) = -4$ N

The negative sign indicates attractive force.

**Answer: (2) 4 N (attractive)**

## Problem 4

**Question:** A body can be negatively charged by

**Solution:**

A body becomes negatively charged when it has an excess of electrons (negative charges) or a deficit of protons (positive charges). Since electrons are mobile and protons are fixed in the nucleus, the practical way to negatively charge a body is to add excess electrons to it.

**Answer: (1) Giving excess of electrons to it**

---

## Problem 5

**Question:** Calculate the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge.

**Solution:**

Charge on one electron: $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C

Number of electrons in 1 C: $n = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{10^{19}}{1.6} = 6.25 \times 10^{18}$

**Answer: $6.25 \times 10^{18}$ electrons**

---

## Problem 6

**Question:** What is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points is 1 V?

**Solution:**

Potential difference of 1 V means that 1 joule of work is done in moving 1 coulomb of charge from one point to another.

Mathematically: $V = \frac{W}{Q}$

If $V = 1$ V, then $W = Q = 1$ J when $Q = 1$ C.

**Answer:** It means that 1 joule of work is done in moving 1 coulomb of charge from one point to another.

## Problem 7

**Question:** Match column I with column II.

**Solution:**

- **(A) Linear charge density** → Charge per unit length → **(2) Charge/Length**
- **(B) Surface charge density** → Charge per unit area → **(3) Charge/Area**
- **(C) Volume charge density** → Charge per unit volume → **(1) Charge/Volume**
- **(D) Discrete charge distribution** → System with individual point charges → **(4) System consisting of ultimate individual charges**

**Answer: (1) (A)→(2), (B)→(3), (C)→(1), (D)→(4)**

---

## Problem 8

**Question:** Match column I with column II.

**Solution:**

- **(A) Additivity of charge** → Charges add algebraically → **(2) $-5 \mu\text{C} + 15 \mu\text{C} = 10 \mu\text{C}$**
- **(B) $\sigma$ is proportional to** → Surface charge density is proportional to curvature → **(1) $1 / (\text{Radius of curvature})^2$**
- **(C) Quantization of charge** → Charge exists in discrete packets → **(4) $q = ne$**
- **(D) Potential difference** → Work done per unit charge → **(3) $W/Q$**

**Answer: (3) (A)→(2), (B)→(1), (C)→(4), (D)→(3)**

---

## Problem 9

**Question:** If a body has positive charge, then what does it mean?

**Solution:**

A body has positive charge when it has:
1. An excess of protons (positive charges), or
2. A deficit of electrons (negative charges)

Since protons are fixed in the nucleus and electrons are mobile, a body typically becomes positively charged by losing electrons.

**Answer:** It means the body has either an excess of positive charges (protons) or a deficit of negative charges (electrons). In practice, it usually means the body has lost some electrons.

## Problem 10

**Question:** Match column I with column II.

**Solution:**

- **(A) Electric potential near an isolated positive charge** → Positive → **(2) Positive**
- **(B) Electric potential near an isolated negative charge** → Negative → **(1) Negative**
- **(C) Electric potential due to a charge at its own location** → Infinite (self-potential) → **(4) Infinite**
- **(D) Electric potential due to point charge at infinity** → Zero (reference point) → **(3) Zero**

**Answer: (1) (A)→(2), (B)→(1), (C)→(4), (D)→(3)**

## Problem 11

**Question:** Consider a system of two charges of magnitude $2 \times 10^{-7}$ C and $4.5 \times 10^{-7}$ C, which is acted upon by a force of 0.1 N. What is the distance between the two charges?

**Solution:**

Given:
- $q_1 = 2 \times 10^{-7}$ C
- $q_2 = 4.5 \times 10^{-7}$ C
- $F = 0.1$ N
- $k = 9 \times 10^9$ N⋅m²/C²

From Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{kq_1 q_2}{r^2}$

$0.1 = \frac{(9 \times 10^9)(2 \times 10^{-7})(4.5 \times 10^{-7})}{r^2}$

$0.1 = \frac{9 \times 10^9 \times 9 \times 10^{-14}}{r^2}$

$0.1 = \frac{81 \times 10^{-5}}{r^2}$

$r^2 = \frac{81 \times 10^{-5}}{0.1} = 81 \times 10^{-4}$

$r = \sqrt{81 \times 10^{-4}} = 9 \times 10^{-2} = 0.09$ m

**Answer: 0.09 m or 9 cm**

## Problem 12

**Question:** Determine the magnitude of the two identical charges when the electrostatic force between these two identical charges is 1000 N and are separated by a distance of 0.1 m.

**Solution:**

Given:
- $F = 1000$ N
- $r = 0.1$ m
- $q_1 = q_2 = q$ (identical charges)
- $k = 9 \times 10^9$ N⋅m²/C²

From Coulomb's law: $F = \frac{kq^2}{r^2}$

$1000 = \frac{(9 \times 10^9)q^2}{(0.1)^2}$

$1000 = \frac{9 \times 10^9 \times q^2}{0.01}$

$1000 = 9 \times 10^{11} \times q^2$

$q^2 = \frac{1000}{9 \times 10^{11}} = \frac{10^3}{9 \times 10^{11}} = \frac{1}{9 \times 10^8}$

$q = \sqrt{\frac{1}{9 \times 10^8}} = \frac{1}{3 \times 10^4} = \frac{1}{30000}$ C

$q = 3.33 \times 10^{-5}$ C

**Answer: $3.33 \times 10^{-5}$ C or $33.3 \mu$C**

## Problem 13

**Question:** How much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a 9 V battery?

**Solution:**

Given: $V = 9$ V

Energy given to charge: $W = QV$

For $Q = 1$ C: $W = 1 \times 9 = 9$ J

**Answer: 9 J**

## Problem 14

**Question:** If $4 \times 10^{-3}$ J of work is done in moving a particle carrying a charge of $16 \times 10^{-6}$ C from infinity to point P. What will be the potential at point P?

**Solution:**

Given:
- $W = 4 \times 10^{-3}$ J
- $Q = 16 \times 10^{-6}$ C

Potential at point P: $V_P = \frac{W}{Q} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-3}}{16 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{4}{16} \times 10^{-3+6} = \frac{1}{4} \times 10^3 = 250$ V

**Answer: 250 V**

---

## Problem 15

**Question:** Calculate the work done in moving a charge of 5 C from a point at a potential of 210 V to another point at 240 V.

**Solution:**

Given:
- $Q = 5$ C
- $V_1 = 210$ V
- $V_2 = 240$ V

Potential difference: $\Delta V = V_2 - V_1 = 240 - 210 = 30$ V

Work done: $W = Q \Delta V = 5 \times 30 = 150$ J

**Answer: 150 J**
