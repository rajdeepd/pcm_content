## Problem 1

**Question:** One ampere-hour is equal to

**Solution:**

1 ampere-hour means 1 ampere of current flowing for 1 hour.

**Given:**
* Current, $I = 1$ A
* Time, $t = 1$ hour $= 3600$ seconds

**Charge:** $Q = I \times t = 1 \times 3600 = 3600$ C

**Answer: (1) 3600 C**

## Problem 2

**Question:** If the electric current through an electric bulb is 3.2 A, the number of electrons that flow through it is

**Solution:**

**Given:** Current, $I = 3.2$ A

Current is defined as charge flowing per unit time. For 1 second:

$Q = I \times t = 3.2 \times 1 = 3.2$ C

Charge on one electron: $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C

Number of electrons: $n = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{3.2}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 2 \times 10^{19}$

**Answer: (2) $2 \times 10^{19}$**

## Problem 3

**Question:** Calculate the resistance of a copper wire of length 1 m and area of cross section 2 mm². Resistivity of copper is $1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ Ωm.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Length, $l = 1$ m
* Area of cross-section, $A = 2$ mm² $= 2 \times 10^{-6}$ m²
* Resistivity, $\rho = 1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ Ωm

**Using the formula:** $R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$

$$R = \frac{1.7 \times 10^{-8} \times 1}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{1.7 \times 10^{-8}}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.85 \times 10^{-2} = 8.5 \times 10^{-3} \Omega$$

**Answer: (4) $8.5 \times 10^{-3}$ Ω**

---

## Problem 4

**Question:** A wire 50-cm long and 1 mm² in cross section carries a current of 4 A when connected to 2-V battery. The resistivity of the wire is

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Length, $l = 50$ cm $= 0.5$ m
* Area of cross-section, $A = 1$ mm² $= 1 \times 10^{-6}$ m²
* Current, $I = 4$ A
* Voltage, $V = 2$ V

**First, find resistance using Ohm's law:**

$$R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \Omega$$

**Now, find resistivity using:** $\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$

$$\rho = \frac{0.5 \times 1 \times 10^{-6}}{0.5} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \Omega\text{m}$$

**Answer: (4) $1 \times 10^{-6}$ Ωm**

## Problem 5

**Question:** Two copper wires, one of length 1 m and the other of length 9 m, have the same resistance. Their diameters are in the ratio

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Length of wire 1, $l_1 = 1$ m
* Length of wire 2, $l_2 = 9$ m
* $R_1 = R_2$ (same resistance)
* Same material (copper), so $\rho_1 = \rho_2$

**Using the formula:** $R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$

For wire 1: $R_1 = \frac{\rho l_1}{A_1}$

For wire 2: $R_2 = \frac{\rho l_2}{A_2}$

Since $R_1 = R_2$:

$$\frac{\rho l_1}{A_1} = \frac{\rho l_2}{A_2}$$

$$\frac{l_1}{A_1} = \frac{l_2}{A_2}$$

$$\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{l_1}{l_2} = \frac{1}{9}$$

Since area $A = \pi r^2 = \pi\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$, we have:

$$\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{d_1^2}{d_2^2} = \frac{1}{9}$$

$$\frac{d_1}{d_2} = \frac{1}{3}$$

Therefore, $d_1 : d_2 = 1 : 3$

**Answer: (2) 1:3**

## Problem 6

**Question:** The electric resistance of a certain wire of iron is R. If its length and radius are both doubled, then

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Original length, $l_1 = l$
* New length, $l_2 = 2l$
* Original radius, $r_1 = r$
* New radius, $r_2 = 2r$

**Original resistance:** $R_1 = \frac{\rho l_1}{A_1} = \frac{\rho l}{\pi r^2}$

**New resistance:** $R_2 = \frac{\rho l_2}{A_2} = \frac{\rho (2l)}{\pi (2r)^2} = \frac{\rho (2l)}{\pi (4r^2)} = \frac{\rho l}{2\pi r^2}$

Comparing:

$$R_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\rho l}{\pi r^2} = \frac{R_1}{2}$$

So the resistance is halved.

**Resistivity** ($\rho$) is a material property and does not change with dimensions. It remains unchanged.

**Answer: (2) The resistance will be halved, and the specific resistance will remain unchanged**

## Problem 7

**Question:** Two wires A and B of equal masses and of the same metal are taken. The diameter of wire A is half of the diameter of wire B. If the resistance of wire A is 24 Ω, then the resistance of wire B will be

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Mass of wire A = Mass of wire B = $m$
* Same material (same density $\delta$ and resistivity $\rho$)
* Diameter of wire A, $d_A = \frac{d_B}{2}$ or $d_B = 2d_A$
* Resistance of wire A, $R_A = 24$ Ω

**Volume = Mass / Density**

Since masses are equal and material is same:
$$V_A = V_B$$
$$A_A l_A = A_B l_B$$

Since $A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}$:
$$\frac{\pi d_A^2}{4} \times l_A = \frac{\pi d_B^2}{4} \times l_B$$
$$d_A^2 l_A = d_B^2 l_B$$

Substituting $d_B = 2d_A$:
$$d_A^2 l_A = (2d_A)^2 l_B = 4d_A^2 l_B$$
$$l_A = 4l_B$$
$$l_B = \frac{l_A}{4}$$

**Resistance formula:** $R = \frac{\rho l}{A} = \frac{\rho l}{\pi d^2/4} = \frac{4\rho l}{\pi d^2}$

**For wire A:**
$$R_A = \frac{4\rho l_A}{\pi d_A^2} = 24 \Omega$$

**For wire B:**
$$R_B = \frac{4\rho l_B}{\pi d_B^2} = \frac{4\rho (l_A/4)}{\pi (2d_A)^2} = \frac{4\rho l_A/4}{\pi 4d_A^2} = \frac{\rho l_A}{4\pi d_A^2}$$

Comparing:
$$R_B = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{4\rho l_A}{\pi d_A^2} = \frac{R_A}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \Omega$$

**Answer: (4) 6 Ω**

## Problem 8

**Question:** A current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10 minutes. Find the amount of electric charge that flows through the circuit.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
* Current, $I = 0.5$ A
* Time, $t = 10$ minutes $= 10 \times 60 = 600$ seconds

**Using the formula:** $Q = I \times t$

$$Q = 0.5 \times 600 = 300 \text{ C}$$

**Answer:** The amount of electric charge that flows through the circuit is 300 C.

## Problem 9

**Question:** Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor.

**Solution:**

A **battery** or **cell** helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor. It provides a constant voltage (potential difference) that drives the current through the circuit.

**Answer:** Battery (or Cell)

## Problem 10

**Question:** What is the commercial unit of electrical energy? Represent it in terms of joules.

**Solution:**

The commercial unit of electrical energy is **kilowatt-hour (kWh)**.

**Conversion to joules:**

1 kilowatt-hour = 1 kW × 1 hour

1 kW = 1000 W = 1000 J/s

1 hour = 3600 seconds

Therefore:
$$1 \text{ kWh} = 1000 \text{ W} \times 3600 \text{ s} = 3,600,000 \text{ J} = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ J}$$

**Answer:** The commercial unit of electrical energy is kilowatt-hour (kWh), which is equal to $3.6 \times 10^6$ joules.

## Problem 11

**Question:** A wire of length 3 m and area of cross section $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$ m² has a resistance $3 \times 10^{-2}$ ohm.

**(a)** What is the formula for resistivity of the wire, and what is its unit?

**(b)** Calculate the resistivity of the wire.

**Solution:**

**(a) Formula for resistivity:**

From the resistance formula: $R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$

Rearranging: $\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$

**Unit:** The SI unit of resistivity is ohm-meter (Ωm).

**(b) Calculation:**

**Given:**
* Length, $l = 3$ m
* Area of cross-section, $A = 1.7 \times 10^{-6}$ m²
* Resistance, $R = 3 \times 10^{-2}$ Ω

**Using the formula:** $\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$

$$\rho = \frac{(3 \times 10^{-2}) \times (1.7 \times 10^{-6})}{3}$$

$$\rho = \frac{5.1 \times 10^{-8}}{3} = 1.7 \times 10^{-8} \Omega\text{m}$$

**Answer:** 
**(a)** Formula: $\rho = \frac{RA}{l}$, Unit: ohm-meter (Ωm)  
**(b)** Resistivity = $1.7 \times 10^{-8}$ Ωm

## Problem 12

**Question:** The table given below shows the resistivity of three materials X, Y and Z:

| Samples | X | Y | Z |
|---------|---|---|---|
| Resistivity | $3 \times 10^{-9}$ Ωm | $11.1 \times 10^{-6}$ Ωm | $18 \times 10^{-17}$ Ωm |

**(a)** Arrange the samples in increasing order of conductivity.

**(b)** Which of these is the best conductor?

**(c)** Which of these is the best insulator?

**Solution:**

**Resistivity values:**
* X: $\rho_X = 3 \times 10^{-9}$ Ωm
* Y: $\rho_Y = 11.1 \times 10^{-6}$ Ωm
* Z: $\rho_Z = 18 \times 10^{-17}$ Ωm

**Note:** Conductivity ($\sigma$) is the reciprocal of resistivity: $\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho}$

Lower resistivity means higher conductivity.

**Comparing resistivities:**
* $\rho_Z = 18 \times 10^{-17} = 1.8 \times 10^{-16}$ Ωm (smallest)
* $\rho_X = 3 \times 10^{-9}$ Ωm (middle)
* $\rho_Y = 11.1 \times 10^{-6}$ Ωm (largest)

**(a) Increasing order of conductivity (decreasing resistivity):**

Z < X < Y

**(b) Best conductor:**

Z has the lowest resistivity ($1.8 \times 10^{-16}$ Ωm), so Z is the best conductor.

**(c) Best insulator:**

Y has the highest resistivity ($11.1 \times 10^{-6}$ Ωm), so Y is the best insulator.

**Answer:**
**(a)** Increasing order of conductivity: Z, X, Y  
**(b)** Z is the best conductor  
**(c)** Y is the best insulator
