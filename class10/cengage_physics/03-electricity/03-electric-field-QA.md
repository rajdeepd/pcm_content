## ✅ Section 3. ELECTRIC FIELD (Page 155)

### Original Text (from page 155):
- **Definition of Electric Field:** "Electric field due to a given charge is defined as the space around the charge in which electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion due to charge can be experienced by any other charge. If a test charge experiences no force at a point, the electric field at that point must be zero."
- **Definition of Electric Field Intensity:** "Electric field intensity at any point is the strength of electric field at that point. It is defined as the force experienced by unit positive charge placed at that point."
- **Formula:** "Formula: If F is the force acting on a test charge +q₀ at any point, then electric field intensity at this point is given by E = F/q₀"
- **Nature of Electric Field:** "Electric field is a vector quantity."
- **SI Unit:** "SI unit: Since force is measured in newton and charge is measured in coulomb (C), electric field intensity is measured in newton per coulomb (N/C)."
