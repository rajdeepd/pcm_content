# Answers

14. Concentric circles centered on the wire. Right-Hand Thumb Rule.
15. No, it does not exert a force on a stationary charge. A magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charge.
16. Because they represent direction of the magnetic field at each point, and a magnetic field cannot have two different directions at the same point.
17. $B = \mu_0 n I$. Here $n = \frac{N}{L} = \frac{100}{0.5} = 200 \text{ turns/m}$.
    $B = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 200 \times 2.5 = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$.
18. $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$.
    $B = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 90}{2\pi \times 1.5} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-7} \times 90}{1.5} = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$.
    Direction: Using Right-Hand Thumb Rule, current is East to West. At a point below, the field is towards South.
19. Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the rate of change of magnetic flux through a closed loop is equal to the induced emf in the loop. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

    $\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$

    where $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux through the loop and $t$ is time. The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the change in magnetic flux, a principle known as Lenz's law.

20. (i) Use insulated tools. (ii) Ensure proper earthing. (iii) Use fuse/MCB of appropriate rating.
21. Downward (Towards North).
22. To reverse the direction of current in the coil every half rotation to maintain unidirectional torque.
23. Vertically Downward. (Fleming's Left-Hand Rule: Motion (opposite to electron) = Front to Back, Force = Right $\implies$ Field = Downward).
24. (i) They originate from North pole and end at South pole outside the magnet. (ii) They are continuous closed curves. (iii) They never intersect each other. (iv) Crowded lines indicate strong field.
