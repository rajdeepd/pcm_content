# Very Short Answer Type Questions
1. The north pole of a magnet is placed near a stationary negatively charged body. Will the pole experience any force?
2. When a charged particle is moving along the direction of magnetic field. How much force is experienced by the charged particle?
3. Name one device which works on the magnetic effect of current.
4. What is the nature of magnetic field lines due to current in a long straight conductor?
5. Which rule will give the direction of force experienced by a current carrying linear conductor placed perpendicular to the magnetic field?
6. What type of force acts between two parallel wires carrying current in the same direction? What happens if one of the current is reversed?
7. Write the formula for magnetic force per unit length between two parallel current carrying long conductors separated by a distance $r$.
8. What is the basic principle of an electric motor?
9. State the principle of an electric generator.
10. Name some sources of direct current.
11. Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.
12. A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is deflected towards north by a magnetic field. What will be the direction of magnetic field?
13. A rectangular coil of copper wires is rotated in a magnetic field. How many times the direction of the induced current changes in one revolution?

# Answers

1. **Yes**. The stationary charge produces an electric field which induces charges on the magnet (electrostatic induction), causing an electrostatic force of attraction. However, the pole will **not** experience any magnetic force because a stationary charge does not produce a magnetic field.
2. $F = qvB \sin(0^\circ) = 0$. Since the particle moves along the magnetic field, the angle is zero.
3. Electric motor, Loudspeaker.
4. Concentric circles centered on the wire.
5. Fleming's Left-Hand Rule.
6. Attractive force. If one current is reversed, the force becomes repulsive.
7. $F = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi r}$
8. A current-carrying coil placed in a magnetic field experiences a torque (force) which causes it to rotate.
9. Electromagnetic Induction: When a conductor is placed in a changing magnetic field, an induced current is produced in it.
10. Solar cells, Batteries (Chemical cells), DC Generators.
11. (Diagram required: Field lines emerge from North pole and merge at South pole externally; S to N internally).
12. Vertically Upward. (Using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule: Motion (Current) = West, Force = North $\implies$ Field = Upward).
13. Twice. The direction of induced current changes every half revolution. Reference <a href="https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/a-rectangular-coil-of-copper-wires-is-rotated-in-class-12-physics-cbse-61055985683c0b2e4c340420">link</a>.
Fleming's Right-Hand Rule is applied.
