26. Electromagnetic induction is the process of inducing an electric current in a conductor by changing the magnetic flux through it. The value of the induced current depends on the following factors:

(i) The strength of the magnetic field
(ii) The rate of change of the magnetic field
(iii) The number of turns in the coil
(iv) The resistance of the coil

The direction of the induced current is determined by Lenz's law, which states that the induced current always opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it.
