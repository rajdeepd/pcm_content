## Problem 7

A beam of α particle is projected into a magnetic field. If the direction of magnetic field is along the velocity of charged particles, the particle gets

**(1)** Accelerated  
**(2)** Decelerated  
**(3)** Deflected  
**(4)** No change in velocity

## Problem 8

An electron is moving in the north direction. It experiences a force in the vertically upward direction. The magnetic field in that region is towards

**(1)** East  
**(2)** West  
**(3)** North  
**(4)** South

---

## Problem 9

A vertical wire carrying a current in the upward direction is placed in a horizontal magnetic field directed towards North. The wire will experience a force directed towards

**(1)** East  
**(2)** West  
**(3)** North  
**(4)** South

## Problem 10

Magnetic field is produced by the flow of electric current in a straight wire. This phenomenon was discovered by

**(1)** Coulomb  
**(2)** Oersted  
**(3)** Faraday  
**(4)** Maxwell

## Problem 11

When a magnetic compass needle is carried nearby to a straight wire carrying current, then

**(I)** The straight wire causes a noticeable deflection in the compass needle.  
**(II)** The alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle with straight wire as its centre and has a plane perpendicular to the wire.

**(1)** (I) is correct  
**(2)** (II) is correct  
**(3)** Both (I) and (II) are correct  
**(4)** Neither (I) nor (II) is correct

## Problem 12

When a magnetic compass is placed in uniform magnetic field, how does the compass needle behave?

**(1)** The needle aligns itself perpendicular to magnetic field.  
**(2)** The needle aligns itself parallel to magnetic field.  
**(3)** The needle moves randomly without setting in any particular direction.  
**(4)** The needle always points towards west.

**Clues:**

**Across:**
1. When an electric current is used to induce a magnetic field, hence showing magnetic properties, known as \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
2. A solenoid behaves like a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ magnet.

**Down:**
2. Fleming's \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hand rule helps to determine direction of force or motion acting on current carrying conductor.
3. The property by a material where it allows the magnetic line of force to pass through it.
4. Magnetism is generated by convection current of molten iron and nickel in the core.
