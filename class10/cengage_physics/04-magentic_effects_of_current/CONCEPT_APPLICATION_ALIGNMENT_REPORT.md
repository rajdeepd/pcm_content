## ✅ CORRECTLY ALIGNED

### Problems 1-3
- **Problem 1:** "What is a magnet?" ✓
- **Problem 2:** "Can the poles of a bar magnet be separated?" ✓
- **Problem 3:** "What do you mean by magnetic lines of force?" ✓

**Status:** All three questions match exactly with the original text.

## ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION

### Problem 4 - Riddles
**Original Text (page 14):**
- Riddle 1: "I'm not alive, but I pull Iron and steel objects, I make them full. A force unseen, but it's clearly there, What am I, found in every hardware store?"
- Riddle 2: "I make needles point to the northern star, My influence extends both near and far. Without me, birds might lose their way, What natural feature am I, can you say?"
- Riddle 3: "I dance and weave, never at rest, Invisible threads, put to the test. Around a bar, or through a wire, I shape my path, never tire. What am I in this magnetic scene?"

**Markdown File:**
- Riddle 1: "I'm not alive, but I pull iron and steel objects, I make them full. A force unseen, but it's clearly there, What am I, found in every hardware store?"
- Riddle 2: "I make needles point to the northern star, My influence extends both near and far. Without me, birds might lose their way, What natural feature am I, can you say?"
- Riddle 3: "I dance and weave, never at rest, Invisible threads, put to the test. Around a bar, or through a wire, I shape my path, never tire. What am I in this magnetic scene?"

**Status:** Minor capitalization difference ("Iron" vs "iron" in Riddle 1). Otherwise matches.

### Problem 5 - Riddle
**Original Text (page 14):**
"Lines of force, both strong and keen. Ampere's rule guides my creation, A right hand grip, a simple equation. Wires, a coil takes shape, Magnetic influence, none can escape. What am I?"

**Markdown File:**
"Lines of force, both strong and keen. Ampere's rule guides my creation, A right hand grip, a simple equation. Wires, a coil takes shape, Magnetic influence, none can escape. What am I?"

**Status:** ✓ Matches exactly.

### Problem 6 - Circular Loop
**Original Text (page 14):**
"The radius of a circular loop is 0.4 m and the current is 12 A. What is the magnitude of magnetic field at the center of the loop?
(1) 6π×10^-6 T (2) 20T (3) Zero (4) 6π×10^-7 T"

**Markdown File:**
"The radius of a circular loop is 0.4 m and the current is 12 A. What is the magnitude of magnetic field at the center of the loop?
(1) $6\pi \times 10^{-6}$ T (2) 20 T (3) Zero (4) $6\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T"

**Status:** ✓ Matches (formatting differences are acceptable for markdown).

## ❌ NUMBERING MISMATCH

### Problem Numbering Discrepancy

**Original Text (page 15):**
- Question 9: "Which of the following graphs represent the variation of magnetic field (B) with distance (R) from an infinitely long straight conductor?"
- Question 10: "Find the ratio of magnetic field at point A and point B inside a long solenoid..."
- Question 11: "An electric current passes through a long straight wire. At a distance 5 cm from the wire, the magnetic field is B. The field at 20 cm from the wire would be"
- Question 12: "A long solenoid carrying a current produce a magnetic field B along its axis. If the current is doubled and the number of turns per cm is halved the new value of the magnetic field is"
- Question 13: "Solve the following crossword puzzle"

**Markdown File:**
- Problem 7: Graph question (should be Problem 9)
- Problem 8: Ratio question (should be Problem 10)
- Problem 9: Distance question (should be Problem 11)
- Problem 10: Solenoid question (should be Problem 12)
- Problem 11: Crossword (should be Problem 13)

**Issue:** The markdown file has Problems 7-11, but the original text shows Questions 9-13. 

**Analysis:** 
- Page 14 shows Problems 1-6 (ending with the circular loop problem labeled as "6")
- Page 15 shows Questions 9-13 (starting with the graph question labeled as "9")
- This suggests Questions 7-8 are either:
  1. On a different page (possibly page 14 continuation or page 15 beginning)
  2. Missing from the original document
  3. The numbering in the original document skips 7-8

**Recommendation:** 
- Check if Questions 7-8 exist elsewhere in the document
- If they don't exist, the markdown file numbering (7-11) should be changed to match the original (9-13), OR
- If Questions 7-8 do exist, they need to be added to the markdown file

## ⚠️ TEXT DIFFERENCES

### Problem 10 (Markdown) / Question 12 (Original)
**Original Text:**
"A long solenoid carrying a current produce a magnetic field B along its axis. If the current is doubled and the number of turns per cm is halved the new value of the magnetic **filed** is"

**Markdown File:**
"A long solenoid carrying a current produce a magnetic field B along its axis. If the current is doubled and the number of turns per cm is halved, the new value of the magnetic field is"

**Status:** 
- Original has typo: "filed" should be "field" ✓ (corrected in markdown)
- Missing comma after "halved" in original ✓ (added in markdown)

## 📋 MISSING CONTENT CHECK

### Problems 12-39
**Status:** These problems (Very Short Answer, Short Answer, Long Answer Type Questions) are NOT present in pages 14-15. They appear to be from a different section or later pages.

**Recommendation:** Verify the source pages for Problems 12-39 to ensure they are correctly extracted.

---

## 🔍 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Numbering Verification:** Check if Problems 7-8 exist in the original document or if the numbering system is different.

2. **Complete Source Verification:** Verify that Problems 12-39 are correctly extracted from their respective source pages.

3. **Formatting Consistency:** Ensure all mathematical expressions are properly formatted with MathJax.

4. **Image Placeholders:** The following problems have TODO notes for images:
   - Problem 7: Graph images for B vs R relationships
   - Problem 8: Figure showing points A and B inside solenoid
   - Problem 11: Crossword puzzle diagram
