## Very Short Answer Type Questions

### Question 1

**Question:** The north pole of a magnet is placed near a stationary negatively charged body. Will the pole experience any force?

**Solution:**

**No**, the north pole will **not** experience any force.

**Explanation:**
- A stationary charged body produces only an **electric field**, not a magnetic field.
- A magnetic pole experiences force only in a **magnetic field**.
- Since there is no magnetic field produced by a stationary charge, the magnetic pole experiences no force.
- However, the charged body may experience a force due to the magnetic field of the magnet, but the magnet itself experiences no force from the stationary charge.

---

### Question 2

**Question:** When a charged particle is moving along the direction of magnetic field. How much force is experienced by the charged particle?

**Solution:**

The charged particle experiences **zero force** ($F = 0$).

**Explanation:**
The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by:
$$F = qvB \sin \theta$$

where:
- $q$ is the charge
- $v$ is the velocity
- $B$ is the magnetic field
- $\theta$ is the angle between velocity and magnetic field

When the particle moves **along** the direction of the magnetic field, $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$, so:
$$\sin 0° = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \sin 180° = 0$$

Therefore: $F = qvB \times 0 = 0$

---

### Question 3

**Question:** Name one device which works on the magnetic effect of current.

**Solution:**

**Electric motor** (or **Electromagnet**, **Loudspeaker**, **Moving coil galvanometer**, **Electric bell**)

**Explanation:**
An electric motor works on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force, causing it to rotate.

---

### Question 4

**Question:** What is the nature of magnetic field lines due to current in a long straight conductor?

**Solution:**

The magnetic field lines due to current in a long straight conductor are **concentric circles** centered on the conductor.

**Explanation:**
- The magnetic field lines form **closed circular loops** around the conductor.
- The circles are **concentric** (having the same center - the conductor).
- The direction of the field lines is given by the **Right Hand Thumb Rule**.
- The field strength decreases as we move away from the conductor ($B \propto \frac{1}{r}$).

---

### Question 5

**Question:** Which rule will give the direction of force experienced by a current carrying linear conductor placed perpendicular to the magnetic field?

**Solution:**

**Fleming's Left Hand Rule** gives the direction of force.

**The Rule:**
If the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the **magnetic field**
- **Second finger** points in the direction of the **current**
- **Thumb** indicates the direction of the **force**

---

### Question 6

**Question:** What type of force acts between two parallel wires carrying current in the same direction? What happens if one of the current is reversed?

**Solution:**

**When currents are in the same direction:** The wires **attract** each other.

**When one current is reversed:** The wires **repel** each other.

**Explanation:**
- When both wires carry current in the same direction, the magnetic fields interact such that the wires attract each other.
- When currents are in opposite directions, the magnetic fields cause the wires to repel each other.
- The force per unit length is given by: $f = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi d}$

---

### Question 7

**Question:** Write the formula for magnetic force per unit length between two parallel current carrying long conductors separated by a distance $r$.

**Solution:**

The magnetic force per unit length between two parallel current-carrying conductors separated by distance $r$ is:

$$f = \frac{\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\pi r} \text{ N/m}$$

where:
- $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T·m/A (permeability of free space)
- $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents in the two conductors
- $r$ is the distance between the conductors

---

### Question 8

**Question:** What is the basic principle of an electric motor?

**Solution:**

The basic principle of an electric motor is that **a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force**, which causes it to rotate.

**Explanation:**
- When a rectangular coil carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, the two vertical sides experience forces in opposite directions.
- These forces create a **torque** that causes the coil to rotate.
- The **commutator** ensures continuous rotation in the same direction by reversing the current every half rotation.

---

### Question 9

**Question:** State the principle of an electric generator.

**Solution:**

The principle of an electric generator is **electromagnetic induction**.

**Statement:**
When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field or the magnetic field associated with a coil changes, an **emf (electromotive force)** is induced in the conductor. This is called electromagnetic induction.

**Explanation:**
- When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the coil changes continuously.
- According to Faraday's law, this changing flux induces an emf in the coil.
- The generator converts **mechanical energy** into **electrical energy**.

---

### Question 10

**Question:** Name some sources of direct current.

**Solution:**

Sources of direct current (DC) include:
1. **Batteries** (dry cells, lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries)
2. **DC generators** (dynamos)
3. **Solar cells** (photovoltaic cells)
4. **Rectifiers** (convert AC to DC)
5. **Fuel cells**

---

### Question 11

**Question:** Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.

**Solution:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing magnetic field lines around a bar magnet

**Description:**
- Magnetic field lines emerge from the **North pole** and enter the **South pole**.
- The field lines form **closed curves**.
- Field lines are **closer together** near the poles (stronger field) and **farther apart** away from the poles (weaker field).
- Field lines **never intersect** each other.
- The direction of the field at any point is given by the tangent to the field line at that point.

---

### Question 12

**Question:** A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is deflected towards north by a magnetic field. What will be the direction of magnetic field?

**Solution:**

The magnetic field is directed **vertically upward** (out of the page).

**Explanation:**
Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule for a positive charge:
- **Thumb** (force): Points **north**
- **Middle finger** (velocity/current): Points **west**
- **Forefinger** (magnetic field): Points **vertically upward** (out of the page)

Alternatively, using the right-hand rule for vector cross product:
- If velocity is west and force is north, then magnetic field must be upward (out of page).

---

### Question 13

**Question:** A rectangular coil of copper wires is rotated in a magnetic field. How many times the direction of the induced current changes in one revolution?

**Solution:**

The direction of the induced current changes **twice** in one complete revolution.

**Explanation:**
- In one complete revolution (360°), the coil passes through the vertical position twice.
- At each vertical position (90° and 270°), the magnetic flux through the coil is zero and changes direction.
- This causes the direction of induced current to reverse.
- Therefore, in one complete revolution, the current direction changes **2 times**.

## Short Answer Type Questions

### Question 14

**Question:** What is the nature of magnetic field produced by a current flowing in a circular coil? Name the rule to find the direction of the magnetic field.

**Solution:**

**Nature of magnetic field:**
The magnetic field produced by a current flowing in a circular coil is:
- **Concentrated** at the center of the coil
- **Uniform** near the center
- **Similar to that of a bar magnet** - with one face acting as North pole and the other as South pole

**Rule to find direction:**
**Right Hand Thumb Rule** (or **Maxwell's Corkscrew Rule**)

**Right Hand Thumb Rule:**
If the right hand is curled around the coil such that the fingers point in the direction of current, then the **thumb** points in the direction of the magnetic field (towards the North pole of the coil).

---

### Question 15

**Question:** Does a constant magnetic field exert a force on a stationary charge? Explain.

**Solution:**

**No**, a constant magnetic field does **not** exert a force on a stationary charge.

**Explanation:**
The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by:
$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

where:
- $q$ is the charge
- $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector
- $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector

For a **stationary charge**, $\vec{v} = 0$, so:
$$\vec{F} = q(0 \times \vec{B}) = 0$$

Therefore, **no force** is exerted on a stationary charge by a magnetic field.

**Note:** A magnetic field can only exert a force on a **moving** charged particle.

---

### Question 16

**Question:** Why two magnetic field lines do not intersect each other?

**Solution:**

Two magnetic field lines **cannot intersect** each other because:

1. **Direction uniqueness:** At any point in space, the magnetic field has a **unique direction**. If two field lines intersected, there would be two different directions of the magnetic field at the point of intersection, which is impossible.

2. **Tangent property:** The direction of the magnetic field at any point is given by the **tangent** to the field line at that point. If two lines intersect, there would be two different tangents (two different directions) at the same point.

3. **Physical impossibility:** The magnetic field is a **vector field** with a single, well-defined value at each point. Having two field lines intersect would violate this fundamental property.

---

### Question 17

**Question:** A solenoid of length 50 cm, having 100 turns, carries a current of 2.5 A. Find the magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Length of solenoid, $l = 50$ cm $= 0.5$ m
- Number of turns, $N = 100$
- Current, $I = 2.5$ A

**Formula:**
The magnetic field inside a long solenoid is:
$$B = \mu_0 n I$$

where $n = \frac{N}{l}$ is the number of turns per unit length.

**Calculation:**
$$n = \frac{N}{l} = \frac{100}{0.5} = 200 \text{ turns/m}$$

$$B = \mu_0 n I = (4\pi \times 10^{-7}) \times 200 \times 2.5$$

$$B = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 500$$

$$B = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

$$B = 6.28 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

**Answer:** The magnetic field in the interior of the solenoid is approximately **$6.28 \times 10^{-4}$ T** (or **$2\pi \times 10^{-4}$ T**).

---

### Question 18

**Question:** A horizontal overhead power line carries a current of 90 A in east to west direction. What is the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field due to this current at a point 1.5 m below the line?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Current, $I = 90$ A
- Distance, $r = 1.5$ m
- Current direction: East to West

**Formula:**
The magnetic field due to a long straight conductor is:
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$$

**Calculation:**
$$B = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 90}{2\pi \times 1.5}$$

$$B = \frac{360\pi \times 10^{-7}}{3\pi}$$

$$B = 120 \times 10^{-7}$$

$$B = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$

**Direction:**
Using the Right Hand Thumb Rule:
- Point thumb in the direction of current (East to West)
- Curl fingers - they point in the direction of magnetic field
- At a point **below** the wire, the magnetic field is directed **from North to South**

**Answer:** 
- **Magnitude:** $1.2 \times 10^{-5}$ T
- **Direction:** North to South (at the point below the wire)

---

### Question 19

**Question:** What are Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction?

**Solution:**

**Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction:**

**First Law:**
Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a circuit changes, an emf is induced in the circuit. The induced emf lasts only as long as the change in magnetic flux continues.

**Second Law:**
The magnitude of the induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the circuit.

**Mathematical Expression:**
$$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$

where:
- $\Phi$ is the magnetic flux
- The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the change in flux (Lenz's law)

**For a coil with $N$ turns:**
$$\text{emf} = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$

---

### Question 20

**Question:** What precautions one should take in the use of electricity?

**Solution:**

Precautions to take while using electricity:

1. **Proper wiring:** Use proper insulated wires and ensure correct connections.
2. **Earthing:** All electrical appliances should be properly earthed to prevent electric shock.
3. **Fuses and circuit breakers:** Use appropriate fuses and circuit breakers to protect against overloading.
4. **Switch off when not in use:** Turn off electrical appliances when not in use to save energy and prevent accidents.
5. **Avoid overloading:** Do not connect too many appliances to a single socket.
6. **Keep away from water:** Never touch electrical appliances with wet hands or use them near water.
7. **Regular maintenance:** Get electrical installations checked regularly by qualified electricians.
8. **Use proper rating:** Use appliances and wires with appropriate current and voltage ratings.
9. **Avoid damaged wires:** Replace damaged or frayed wires immediately.
10. **Child safety:** Keep electrical outlets covered and out of reach of children.

---

### Question 21

**Question:** A current through a horizontal overhead power line flows in east-west direction. What is the direction of magnetic field lines at a point just above the line?

**Solution:**

The direction of magnetic field lines at a point just above the line is **from North to South**.

**Explanation:**
Using the **Right Hand Thumb Rule**:
- Point the thumb of your right hand in the direction of current (East to West)
- Curl your fingers - they indicate the direction of magnetic field lines
- At a point **above** the wire, the magnetic field lines are directed **from North to South**

The magnetic field lines form concentric circles around the wire, and at any point above the wire, the field is directed from North to South.

---

### Question 22

**Question:** What is the role of the split ring in an electric motor?

**Solution:**

The **split ring** (commutator) in an electric motor serves the following roles:

1. **Reverses current direction:** The split ring reverses the direction of current in the coil every time the coil passes through the vertical position (every half rotation).

2. **Ensures continuous rotation:** Without the split ring, the coil would oscillate back and forth. The split ring ensures that the coil continues to rotate in the **same direction**.

3. **Maintains unidirectional torque:** By reversing the current at the right moment, the split ring ensures that the torque always acts in the same direction, causing continuous rotation.

4. **Electrical contact:** The split ring maintains electrical contact with the brushes while rotating, allowing current to flow through the coil.

**Working:**
- When the coil is in the horizontal position, current flows in one direction.
- As the coil rotates and reaches the vertical position, the split ring segments swap contact with the brushes.
- This reverses the current direction, ensuring the coil continues rotating in the same direction.

---

### Question 23

**Question:** Imagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall. An electron beam, moving horizontally from back wall towards the front wall, is deflected by a strong magnetic field to your right side. What is the direction of magnetic field?

**Solution:**

The magnetic field is directed **vertically downward** (into the floor).

**Explanation:**
- **Electron beam direction:** From back wall to front wall (towards you)
- **Deflection:** To your right side
- **Charge:** Electron (negative charge)

For an **electron** (negative charge), the force direction is **opposite** to what Fleming's Left Hand Rule would give for a positive charge.

Using the right-hand rule for vector cross product:
- If velocity is from back to front (towards you)
- And force is to your right
- Then magnetic field must be **vertically downward** (into the floor)

**Verification:**
For a positive charge moving forward with force to the right, the magnetic field would be upward. For an electron (negative charge), the force is opposite, so the field is downward.

---

### Question 24

**Question:** List the properties of magnetic lines of force.

**Solution:**

**Properties of Magnetic Lines of Force:**

1. **Closed curves:** Magnetic field lines are always **closed curves**. They form continuous loops.

2. **Direction:** Magnetic field lines emerge from the **North pole** and enter the **South pole** of a magnet.

3. **Never intersect:** Two magnetic field lines **never intersect** each other. If they did, there would be two directions of magnetic field at the point of intersection, which is impossible.

4. **Tangent direction:** The **tangent** to a magnetic field line at any point gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point.

5. **Density indicates strength:** The **density** (closeness) of field lines indicates the **strength** of the magnetic field. Closer lines mean stronger field.

6. **Relative strength:** Where field lines are **closer together**, the magnetic field is **stronger**. Where they are **farther apart**, the field is **weaker**.

7. **Outside magnet:** Outside a magnet, field lines go from North to South.

8. **Inside magnet:** Inside a magnet, field lines go from South to North, completing the closed loop.

---

### Question 25

**Question:** Draw a diagram to represent uniform magnetic field.

**Solution:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing uniform magnetic field

**Description:**
A uniform magnetic field is represented by:
- **Parallel, straight lines** (all pointing in the same direction)
- **Equally spaced** lines (indicating constant field strength)
- All lines are **parallel** to each other
- The direction of the field is indicated by arrows on the lines

**Example:** The magnetic field between the poles of a strong horseshoe magnet or inside a long solenoid is approximately uniform.

## Long Answer Type Questions

### Question 26

**Question:** What is electromagnetic induction? On what factors does the value of induced current produced in a circuit depend? Name and state the rule used for determination of direction of induced current. State one application of this phenomenon in everyday life.

**Solution:**

**1. Electromagnetic Induction:**

Electromagnetic induction is the phenomenon of production of **emf (electromotive force)** or **current** in a conductor by continuously changing the magnetic field associated with it.

When a conductor is moved in a magnetic field or the magnetic field associated with a coil changes, an emf is induced in the conductor. If the circuit is closed, an induced current flows.

**2. Factors on which induced current depends:**

The value of induced current produced in a circuit depends on:

a. **Rate of change of magnetic flux:** Faster the change in magnetic flux, greater is the induced current.
   $$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$

b. **Number of turns in the coil:** More the number of turns, greater is the induced current.
   $$\text{emf} = -N\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$

c. **Resistance of the circuit:** Less the resistance, more is the induced current (from Ohm's law: $I = \frac{\text{emf}}{R}$).

d. **Area of the coil:** Larger the area, more is the magnetic flux, leading to greater induced current.

e. **Strength of magnetic field:** Stronger the magnetic field, greater is the induced current.

f. **Speed of motion:** Faster the relative motion between conductor and magnetic field, greater is the induced current.

**3. Rule for direction of induced current:**

**Fleming's Right Hand Rule** is used to determine the direction of induced current.

**Statement:**
If the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of the right hand are stretched at right angles to each other:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the **magnetic field**
- **Thumb** points in the direction of **motion of the conductor**
- **Second finger** indicates the direction of **induced current** in the conductor

**4. Application in everyday life:**

**Electric Generator:** Electric generators work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. They convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, the changing magnetic flux induces an alternating current, which is used to power homes, industries, and various electrical appliances.

**Other applications:**
- Transformers (step-up and step-down)
- Induction cooktops
- Wireless charging
- Electric guitars (pickups)
- Magnetic card readers

### Question 27

**Question:** Draw a labelled diagram of AC generator. Explain the principle and working of AC generator.

**Solution:**

> **TODO:** Add labelled diagram of AC generator showing:
> - Armature coil (abcd)
> - Field magnet (N and S poles)
> - Slip rings (R₁ and R₂)
> - Carbon brushes (B₁ and B₂)
> - External load/resistance
> - Direction of rotation
> - Magnetic field lines

**Principle:**

An AC generator works on the principle of **electromagnetic induction**. According to Faraday's law, whenever the magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an emf is induced in the coil. In an AC generator, a coil is rotated in a uniform magnetic field such that the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes continuously, inducing an alternating emf.

**Construction:**

1. **Armature:** A rectangular coil (abcd) consisting of a large number of turns of insulated copper wire wound on a soft iron core.

2. **Field Magnet:** A strong permanent magnet (or electromagnet) with North and South poles, producing a uniform magnetic field.

3. **Slip Rings:** Two brass rings (R₁ and R₂) connected to the ends of the coil, rotating with the coil.

4. **Carbon Brushes:** Two carbon brushes (B₁ and B₂) pressed against the slip rings, maintaining sliding contact and supplying current to the external circuit.

**Working:**

1. **Initial Position (0°):**
   - The coil is horizontal.
   - Magnetic flux through the coil is maximum.
   - Induced emf is zero (rate of change of flux is zero).

2. **Rotation (0° to 90°):**
   - As the coil rotates, the magnetic flux through it decreases.
   - An emf is induced, and current flows in one direction (say, clockwise).

3. **At 90°:**
   - The coil is vertical.
   - Magnetic flux through the coil is zero.
   - Induced emf is maximum (rate of change of flux is maximum).

4. **Rotation (90° to 180°):**
   - The coil continues rotating.
   - Magnetic flux increases in the opposite direction.
   - Induced emf decreases, and current direction remains the same.

5. **At 180°:**
   - The coil is horizontal again (opposite to initial position).
   - Magnetic flux is maximum (opposite direction).
   - Induced emf is zero again.

6. **Rotation (180° to 360°):**
   - The process repeats, but the current direction reverses.
   - This produces an **alternating current** (AC).

**Key Points:**

- The **slip rings** allow the coil to rotate continuously while maintaining electrical contact.
- The emf produced is **alternating** (changes direction periodically).
- The frequency of AC depends on the speed of rotation.
- The magnitude of induced emf depends on:
  - Number of turns in the coil
  - Strength of magnetic field
  - Area of the coil
  - Angular velocity of rotation

**Output:**
The AC generator produces an alternating emf and current that varies sinusoidally with time, which is used to power electrical appliances and is distributed through power grids.

**Question:** What is an electromagnet and what are its uses?

**Solution:**

**Electromagnet:**
An electromagnet is a temporary magnet made by winding a coil of insulated wire around a soft iron core. When electric current flows through the coil, the soft iron core becomes magnetized and behaves like a magnet. When the current is switched off, the magnetism is lost.

**Uses of Electromagnet:**
1. **Electric bells** - To produce sound by attracting a hammer
2. **Electric motors** - To create magnetic field for rotation
3. **Loudspeakers** - To convert electrical signals to sound
4. **Magnetic cranes** - To lift and move heavy iron objects
5. **Telephones** - In receivers and transmitters
6. **Relays** - To switch circuits on and off
7. **MRI machines** - In medical imaging
8. **Magnetic locks** - For security systems

**(i) Draw a labelled diagram to show how an electromagnet is made.**

**Solution:**

> **TODO:** Add labelled diagram showing:
> - Soft iron core (cylindrical)
> - Insulated copper wire wound around the core
> - Battery connected to the coil
> - Switch in the circuit
> - Labels: Soft iron core, Coil, Battery, Switch

**Description:**
- A soft iron core is taken
- An insulated copper wire is wound around it to form a coil
- The ends of the wire are connected to a battery through a switch
- When the switch is closed, current flows and the iron core becomes magnetized

**(ii) What is the purpose of soft iron core used in making an electromagnet?**

**Solution:**

The purpose of soft iron core in an electromagnet:

1. **High permeability:** Soft iron has high magnetic permeability, which means it allows magnetic field lines to pass through it easily, concentrating the magnetic field.

2. **Low retentivity:** Soft iron loses its magnetism quickly when current is switched off, making it suitable for temporary magnets.

3. **Increases magnetic strength:** The soft iron core increases the strength of the magnetic field produced by the coil, making the electromagnet much stronger than a coil without a core.

4. **Easy magnetization and demagnetization:** Soft iron can be easily magnetized and demagnetized, which is essential for an electromagnet that needs to work on and off.

- The field is **strongest at the center** of the coil
- Direction is given by **Right Hand Thumb Rule**

**(ii) Long straight solenoid carrying current:**

---

### Give Reasons Question

**Question:** Give reasons

**(i)** A freely suspended magnet stays at north south direction.

**Solution:**

A freely suspended magnet stays in the north-south direction because:

- The Earth itself behaves like a **huge magnet** with its magnetic poles near the geographic poles
- The **magnetic South pole** of the Earth is near the geographic North pole
- A freely suspended magnet aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field
- The **North pole** of the magnet points towards the geographic North (which is actually the magnetic South pole of Earth)
- This alignment occurs due to the **magnetic force** exerted by Earth's magnetic field

**(ii)** Current is induced in a coil rotating in a uniform magnetic field.

**Solution:**

Current is induced in a coil rotating in a uniform magnetic field because:

- When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, the **magnetic flux** linked with the coil **changes continuously**
- According to **Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction**, a changing magnetic flux induces an emf in the coil
- When the coil is part of a closed circuit, the induced emf causes an **induced current** to flow
- The direction of induced current changes as the coil rotates, producing **alternating current (AC)**

**(iii)** When two circular coils are placed close to each other and current in one of the coil is changed, some current is induced in the other coil.

**Solution:**

When current in one coil changes, current is induced in the other coil because:

- When current in coil A changes, the **magnetic field** produced by coil A changes
- This changing magnetic field links with coil B, causing the **magnetic flux** through coil B to change
- According to **Faraday's law**, a changing magnetic flux induces an emf in coil B
- If coil B is part of a closed circuit, an **induced current** flows in it
- This is the principle of **mutual induction** and is used in transformers

**(iv)** Earth wire is used in electrical appliances.

**Solution:**

Earth wire is used in electrical appliances for **safety**:

1. **Protection against electric shock:** If the live wire accidentally touches the metal body of an appliance, the earth wire provides a low-resistance path for the current to flow to the ground
2. **Prevents electric shock:** The current flows through the earth wire instead of through a person touching the appliance
3. **Automatic circuit breaking:** The large current through the earth wire causes the fuse or circuit breaker to trip, cutting off the power supply
4. **Grounding:** It ensures that the metal body of the appliance is at zero potential (ground potential), preventing dangerous voltage buildup

### Question 1: Solenoid Behavior

**Question:** How does a solenoid behave like a magnet? Can you determine the north and south poles of a current-carrying solenoid with the help of a bar magnet? Explain.

**Solution:**

**How a solenoid behaves like a magnet:**

1. When current flows through a solenoid, it produces a **magnetic field** similar to that of a bar magnet
2. One end of the solenoid behaves like a **North pole** and the other end like a **South pole**
3. The magnetic field inside the solenoid is **uniform** and **strong**
4. The magnetic field outside the solenoid is similar to that of a bar magnet
5. The solenoid can **attract** magnetic materials like iron when current flows through it

**Determining North and South poles using a bar magnet:**

**Yes**, we can determine the poles of a current-carrying solenoid using a bar magnet:

1. **Method:** Bring the **North pole** of a bar magnet near one end of the solenoid
2. **Observation:**

## HOTS Questions - Solutions

### Question 31

**Question:** A region A has magnetic field lines relatively closer than another region B. Which region has stronger magnetic field? Give reason to support your answer.

**Solution:**

**Region A** has a **stronger magnetic field**.

**Reason:**
- The **density** (closeness) of magnetic field lines indicates the **strength** of the magnetic field
- Where field lines are **closer together**, the magnetic field is **stronger**
- Where field lines are **farther apart**, the magnetic field is **weaker**
- Since region A has field lines **closer together** than region B, region A has a **stronger magnetic field**

**Mathematical relation:**
The magnetic field strength is inversely proportional to the spacing between field lines:
$$B \propto \frac{1}{\text{spacing between field lines}}$$

### Question 33

**Question:** What does the divergence of magnetic field lines near the ends of a current-carrying straight solenoid indicate?

**Solution:**

The divergence (spreading out) of magnetic field lines near the ends of a current-carrying straight solenoid indicates:

1. **Non-uniform magnetic field:** The magnetic field is **not uniform** near the ends of the solenoid
2. **Weaker field strength:** The magnetic field is **weaker** at the ends compared to the center
3. **Field spreading:** The magnetic field **spreads out** or **diverges** as it exits the solenoid
4. **Bar magnet behavior:** The field pattern near the ends is similar to that near the poles of a bar magnet, where field lines diverge

**Inside vs. Outside:**
- **Inside the solenoid:** Field lines are parallel and close together (uniform, strong field)
- **Near the ends:** Field lines start to diverge (non-uniform, weaker field)
- **Far from the solenoid:** Field lines spread out like those of a bar magnet

### Question 34

**Question:** A magnetic compass shows a deflection when placed near a current-carrying wire. How will the deflection of the compass get affected if the current in the wire is increased? Support your answer with a reason.

**Solution:**

The **deflection of the compass will increase** if the current in the wire is increased.

**Reason:**
- The magnetic field strength around a current-carrying wire is **directly proportional** to the current: $B \propto I$
- When current increases, the **magnetic field strength** increases
- A stronger magnetic field exerts a **greater force** on the compass needle
- This greater force causes a **larger deflection** of the compass needle

**Mathematical relation:**
For a straight wire: $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$

As $I$ increases, $B$ increases, leading to greater deflection.

### Question 35

**Question:** What happens to the direction of magnetic field around a current-carrying wire if the direction of current is reversed and why?

**Solution:**

If the direction of current is reversed, the **direction of the magnetic field is also reversed**.

**Reason:**
- The direction of the magnetic field around a current-carrying wire is determined by the **direction of current**
- According to the **Right Hand Thumb Rule**, if you point your thumb in the direction of current, your curled fingers show the direction of the magnetic field
- When current direction reverses, the thumb points in the opposite direction
- Therefore, the curled fingers (magnetic field direction) also reverse

**Example:**
- If current flows **upward** and magnetic field is **clockwise** (as seen from above)
- When current flows **downward**, magnetic field becomes **anticlockwise** (as seen from above)

**Mathematical representation:**
The magnetic field is given by: $\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi r} \vec{I} \times \hat{r}$

When $\vec{I}$ reverses, $\vec{B}$ also reverses direction.

### Question 36

**Question:** The front face of a circular wire carrying current behaves like a North pole. Identify the direction of current in face of the circular wire.

**Solution:**

The current is flowing in the **clockwise direction** (as seen from the front face).

**Explanation:**
Using the **Right Hand Thumb Rule** for a circular coil:
- If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of current
- Your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field (towards the North pole)
- If the front face behaves like a **North pole**, the thumb points **towards you** (out of the page)
- This means the fingers are curled **clockwise** (as seen from the front)
- Therefore, the current flows in the **clockwise direction**

**Alternative method:**
- If the front face is North pole, the magnetic field emerges from it
- Using Maxwell's corkscrew rule or right-hand rule, clockwise current produces a North pole on the front face

### Question 37

**Question:** State the conclusions that can be drawn from the observation that a current-carrying wire deflects a magnetic needle placed near it.

**Solution:**

The following conclusions can be drawn:

1. **Electric current produces magnetic field:** The deflection of the magnetic needle indicates that a **magnetic field** is produced around a current-carrying wire.

2. **Magnetic effect of current:** This demonstrates that **electricity and magnetism are related** - electric current has a magnetic effect.

3. **Direction of field:** The direction of deflection indicates the **direction of the magnetic field** at that point.

4. **Field strength:** The amount of deflection indicates the **strength of the magnetic field** - stronger current produces stronger field and greater deflection.

5. **Oersted's discovery:** This observation confirms **Oersted's discovery** that electric current produces a magnetic field.

6. **Right-hand rule:** The direction of deflection follows the **Right Hand Thumb Rule** for determining magnetic field direction.

7. **Reversible effect:** If current direction is reversed, the deflection direction also reverses, showing the magnetic field direction depends on current direction.

### Question 38

**Question:** Identify the region where the magnetic field around a current-carrying solenoid is uniform.

**Solution:**

The magnetic field around a current-carrying solenoid is **uniform inside the solenoid** (in the central region, away from the ends).

**Characteristics of uniform field region:**
1. **Inside the solenoid:** The field lines are **straight, parallel, and equally spaced**
2. **Central region:** The field is most uniform in the **middle portion**, away from the ends
3. **Constant magnitude:** The magnetic field strength is **constant** (same value) throughout this region
4. **Constant direction:** The magnetic field has the **same direction** at all points

**Why uniform inside:**
- The field lines inside a long solenoid are parallel and evenly distributed
- The formula $B = \mu_0 n I$ gives constant field strength inside
- Near the ends, field lines diverge, making the field non-uniform

**Outside the solenoid:**
- The field is **non-uniform** and similar to that of a bar magnet
- Field lines spread out and diverge near the ends

### Question 39

**Question:** What name is given to the device which automatically cut-off the electrical supply during short circuiting in household wiring?

**Solution:**

The device is called a **Circuit Breaker** (or **MCB - Miniature Circuit Breaker**).

**Alternative answers:**
- **Fuse** - Also cuts off supply but needs to be replaced after use
- **MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker)** - Modern device that automatically trips and can be reset
- **Earth Leakage Circuit Breaker (ELCB)** - For protection against earth leakage

**Working:**
- When a short circuit occurs, a **large current** flows
- The circuit breaker **detects** this excessive current
- It **automatically trips** (switches off) to cut the electrical supply
- This **protects** the wiring and appliances from damage
- The circuit breaker can be **reset** after the fault is corrected

**Solution:**

<img src="./images/m-fig37.png" width="50%"/>

**To determine the poles:**

Using the **Right Hand Thumb Rule** for a solenoid:
- Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of current flow
- Your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic field (towards the North pole)

**Analysis:**
- Looking at the current direction in the coil
- If current flows in a **clockwise direction** when viewed from end A, then end A is the **South pole** and end B is the **North pole**
- If current flows in an **anticlockwise direction** when viewed from end A, then end A is the **North pole** and end B is the **South pole**

**Based on the diagram:**
- The current direction arrows indicate the flow
- Following the right-hand rule, the end where the thumb points (magnetic field emerges) is the **North pole**
- The opposite end is the **South pole**

**Answer:** 
- End **A**: [North/South pole - depends on current direction]
- End **B**: [South/North pole - opposite of A]

> **Note:** The exact pole assignment depends on the specific current direction shown in the diagram. The right-hand rule should be applied to determine which end is North and which is South.

### Question 41

**Question:** With the help of a labelled circuit diagram illustrate the pattern of field lines of the magnetic field around a long current carrying straight conducting wire. How is the right-hand thumb rule useful to find direction of magnetic field associated with a current carrying conductor?

**Solution:**

> **TODO:** Add labelled diagram showing:
> - Long straight wire carrying current
> - Concentric circular field lines around the wire
> - Direction arrows on field lines
> - Right hand with thumb pointing in current direction and curled fingers showing field direction
> - Labels: Current (I), Magnetic field (B), Wire

**Pattern of Field Lines:**

1. **Shape:** Magnetic field lines form **concentric circles** around the wire
2. **Center:** The wire is at the **center** of these circles
3. **Plane:** The circles lie in a **plane perpendicular** to the wire
4. **Spacing:** Field lines are **closer together** near the wire (stronger field) and **farther apart** away from the wire (weaker field)
5. **Direction:** The direction of field lines is given by the **Right Hand Thumb Rule**

**Right Hand Thumb Rule:**

**The Rule:**
- Hold the wire in your **right hand**
- Point your **thumb** in the direction of **current flow**
- Your **curled fingers** indicate the **direction of magnetic field lines** around the wire

**How it's useful:**

1. **Determines direction:** It helps determine the **direction** of the magnetic field at any point around the wire
2. **Visual representation:** It provides a simple way to visualize the field direction
3. **Consistent method:** It gives a **consistent and reliable** method to find field direction
4. **Easy to apply:** It's a **simple, easy-to-remember** rule that can be applied quickly
5. **Works for all cases:** It works for straight wires, circular coils, and solenoids

**Example:**
- If current flows **upward** in a vertical wire
- Point thumb **upward**
- Curled fingers show field is **clockwise** (as seen from above)
- If current flows **downward**, field becomes **anticlockwise**

**Mathematical relation:**
The magnetic field strength: $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
- $B$ is proportional to current $I$
- $B$ is inversely proportional to distance $r$ from the wire
