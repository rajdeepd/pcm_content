- **Result:** Problems now align with original document:
  - Problem 7: Placeholder (TODO)
  - Problem 8: Placeholder (TODO)
  - Problem 9: Graph question (was Problem 7)
  - Problem 10: Solenoid ratio question (was Problem 8)
  - Problem 11: Distance question (was Problem 9)
  - Problem 12: Solenoid field question (was Problem 10)
  - Problem 13: Crossword puzzle (was Problem 11)

### 2. Text Corrections
- **Fixed:** Capitalization in Problem 4 Riddle 1: "iron" → "Iron" (to match original)
- **Verified:** All other text matches original content

#### Problem 38
- **TODO:** Add labelled diagram of AC generator showing all components (armature, slip rings, brushes, magnetic field, etc.)

#### Problem 39
- **TODO:** Add labelled diagram showing how an electromagnet is made (solenoid with iron core, battery, switch)
- **TODO:** Add three separate diagrams:
  - Diagram 1: Magnetic field lines due to circular coil carrying current
