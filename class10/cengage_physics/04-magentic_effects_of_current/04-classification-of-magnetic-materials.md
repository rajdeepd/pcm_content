# 04. Classification of Magnetic Materials

## 4.1 Classification

**(i) Magnetic Materials:** The substances which are attracted by a magnet.

**Examples:** Iron, cobalt, Nickel and their alloys

**(ii) Non-Magnetic Materials:** The substances which are not attracted by a magnet.

**Examples:** Wood, plastic, copper, etc.

## 4.2 Magnetic Behaviour of Materials

All magnetic materials are divided into three classes:

### (1) Diamagnetic Materials

Materials which when placed in a magnetising field get feebly magnetised in a direction opposite to the magnetising field are called diamagnetic materials. The field inside the material is reduced.

**Examples:** Copper, lead, silicon, nitrogen, water, sodium chloride, silver, mercury, inert gases (He, Ne, Ar, etc.).

### (2) Paramagnetic Materials

Materials which when placed in a magnetising field get feebly magnetised in the direction of magnetising field are called paramagnetic materials. Thus magnetic field inside them increases.

**Examples:** Al, Na, Ca, CuCl₂, Mg, Mn, Sn, K, Pt, FeCl₂, liquid O₂, etc.

### (3) Ferromagnetic Materials

Materials which when placed in a magnetising field get strongly magnetised in the direction of field are called ferromagnetic materials.

**Examples:** Nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co), Iron (Fe), Alnico, Steel, Gadolinium (Gd).

**Note:** The field in which a magnetic material is placed for its magnetisation is called 'magnetising field'.
