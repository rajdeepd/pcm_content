# 07. Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field

## Fleming's Left Hand Rule

By John Ambrose Fleming (1849-1945), suggested a rule for finding the direction of the force experienced by a current-carrying wire placed in a magnetic field that is perpendicular to the current in the wire.

If the forefinger, the second finger and the thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other, the forefinger pointing in the direction of the field and the second finger in the direction of the current then thumb indicates the direction of the force. It is called Fleming's left-hand rule.
