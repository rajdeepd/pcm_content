## Problem 1

**Question:** What is a magnet?

**Solution:** A magnet is a material that produces a magnetic field around it. It can attract materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt. A magnet has two poles - north and south poles - which always exist together and cannot be separated.

---

## Problem 2

**Question:** Can the poles of a bar magnet be separated?

**Solution:** **No**, the poles of a bar magnet cannot be separated. If a bar magnet is broken into pieces, each piece will have both north and south poles. The two poles always exist together as a pair.

---

## Problem 3

**Question:** What do you mean by magnetic lines of force?

**Solution:** Magnetic lines of force (also called magnetic field lines) are imaginary lines that represent the magnetic field. The tangent to a magnetic field line at any point gives the direction of the magnetic field at that point. They are continuous closed curves that emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole.

**Solution:** **Magnetic field** (produced by a current-carrying coil)

---

## Problem 6

**Question:** The radius of a circular loop is 0.4 m and the current is 12 A. What is the magnitude of magnetic field at the center of the loop?

**(1)** $6\pi \times 10^{-6}$ T  
**(2)** 20 T  
**(3)** Zero  
**(4)** $6\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T

**Solution:**

The magnetic field at the center of a circular loop is given by:

$$B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2r}$$

Where:
- $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ T·m/A
- $I = 12$ A
- $r = 0.4$ m

$$B = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 12}{2 \times 0.4} = \frac{48\pi \times 10^{-7}}{0.8} = 60\pi \times 10^{-7} = 6\pi \times 10^{-6} \text{ T}$$

**Answer:** **(1)** $6\pi \times 10^{-6}$ T

---

## Problem 7

**Question:** Which of the following graphs represent the variation of magnetic field (B) with distance (R) from an infinitely long straight conductor?

**Solution:** For an infinitely long straight conductor, the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance: $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi R}$. Therefore, $B \propto \frac{1}{R}$.

The graph should show a hyperbola where B decreases as R increases.

> **TODO:** Add graph images showing the correct B vs R relationship (four graph options)

---

## Problem 8

**Question:** Find the ratio of magnetic field at point A and point B inside a long solenoid as shown in the given figure.

> **TODO:** Add figure showing points A and B inside a long solenoid with labeled points

**(1)** 1:1  
**(2)** 1:2  
**(3)** 3:1  
**(4)** 2:1

**Solution:** Inside a long solenoid, the magnetic field is uniform (constant) throughout. Therefore, the magnetic field at point A and point B will be the same.

**Answer:** **(1)** 1:1

---

## Problem 9

**Question:** An electric current passes through a long straight wire. At a distance 5 cm from the wire, the magnetic field is B. The field at 20 cm from the wire would be

<img src="./images/m-fig19.png" width="60%"/>

**(1)** $\frac{B}{4}$  
**(2)** $\frac{B}{2}$  
**(3)** $3B$  
**(4)** $\frac{B}{3}$

**Solution:**

For a long straight wire, $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$, so $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$.

If $B_1 = B$ at $r_1 = 5$ cm, then at $r_2 = 20$ cm:

$$\frac{B_2}{B_1} = \frac{r_1}{r_2} = \frac{5}{20} = \frac{1}{4}$$

Therefore, $B_2 = \frac{B}{4}$

**Answer:** **(1)** $\frac{B}{4}$

---

## Problem 10

**Question:** A long solenoid carrying a current produce a magnetic field B along its axis. If the current is doubled and the number of turns per cm is halved, the new value of the magnetic field is

<img src="./images/m-fig20.png" width="60%"/>

**(1)** $B$  
**(2)** $2B$  
**(3)** $4B$  
**(4)** $\frac{B}{2}$

**Solution:**

For a solenoid, $B = \mu_0 n I$, where $n$ is the number of turns per unit length.

Initially: $B = \mu_0 n I$

After changes:
- Current: $I' = 2I$
- Turns per cm: $n' = \frac{n}{2}$

New magnetic field: $B' = \mu_0 n' I' = \mu_0 \left(\frac{n}{2}\right)(2I) = \mu_0 n I = B$

**Answer:** **(1)** $B$

## Very Short Answer Type Questions - Solutions

## Problem 12

**Question:** The north pole of a magnet is placed near a stationary negatively charged body. Will the pole experience any force?

**Solution:** **Yes**. The stationary charge produces an electric field which induces charges on the magnet (electrostatic induction), causing an electrostatic force of attraction. However, the pole will **not** experience any magnetic force because a stationary charge does not produce a magnetic field.

---

## Problem 13

**Question:** When a charged particle is moving along the direction of magnetic field. How much force is experienced by the charged particle?

**Solution:** $F = qvB \sin(0^\circ) = 0$. Since the particle moves along the magnetic field, the angle is zero.

## Problem 23

**Question:** A positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is deflected towards north by a magnetic field. What will be the direction of magnetic field?

**Solution:** Vertically Upward. (Using Fleming's Left-Hand Rule: Motion (Current) = West, Force = North $\implies$ Field = Upward).

---

## Problem 24

**Solution:** No, it does not exert a force on a stationary charge. A magnetic field exerts a force on a moving charge.

---

## Problem 27

**Question:** Why two magnetic field lines do not intersect each other?

**Solution:** Because they represent direction of the magnetic field at each point, and a magnetic field cannot have two different directions at the same point.

---

## Problem 28

**Question:** A solenoid of length 50 cm, having 100 turns carries a current of 2.5 A. Find the magnetic field inside the interior of the solenoid.

**Solution:** $B = \mu_0 n I$. Here $n = \frac{N}{L} = \frac{100}{0.5} = 200 \text{ turns/m}$.

$$B = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 200 \times 2.5 = 2\pi \times 10^{-4} \text{ T} \approx 6.28 \times 10^{-4} \text{ T}$$

## Problem 29

**Question:** A horizontal overhead power line carries a current of 90 A in east to west direction. What is magnitude and direction of the magnetic field due to this current at a point 1.5 m below the line?

**Solution:** $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$.

$$B = \frac{4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 90}{2\pi \times 1.5} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-7} \times 90}{1.5} = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ T}$$

Direction: Using Right-Hand Thumb Rule, current is East to West. At a point below, the field is towards South.

---

## Problem 30

**Question:** State Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction?

**Solution:** Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the rate of change of magnetic flux through a closed loop is equal to the induced emf in the loop. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$\text{emf} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$

where $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux through the loop and $t$ is time. The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the change in magnetic flux, a principle known as Lenz's law.

## Long Answer Type Questions - Solutions

## Problem 37

**Question:** What is electromagnetic induction? On what factors does the value of induced current produced in a circuit depend? Name and state the rules used for determination of direction of induced current. State one application of this phenomenon in everyday life.

**Solution:** Electromagnetic induction is the process of inducing an electric current in a conductor by changing the magnetic flux through it. The value of the induced current depends on the following factors:
