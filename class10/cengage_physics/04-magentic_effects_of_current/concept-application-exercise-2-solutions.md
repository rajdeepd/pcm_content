## Problem 7

**Question:** A beam of α particle is projected into a magnetic field. If the direction of magnetic field is along the velocity of charged particles, the particle gets

**Solution:**

When a charged particle moves parallel (or antiparallel) to the magnetic field, the angle between velocity and magnetic field is $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$.

The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by:
$$F = qvB \sin \theta$$

When $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$, $\sin \theta = 0$, so:
$$F = qvB \times 0 = 0$$

Since there is no force acting on the particle, it will continue moving with the same velocity (no acceleration, no deceleration, no deflection).

**Answer: (4) No change in velocity**

## Problem 8

**Question:** An electron is moving in the north direction. It experiences a force in the vertically upward direction. The magnetic field in that region is towards

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Electron moving **north** (velocity $\vec{v}$ is northward)
- Force is **vertically upward**
- Electron has **negative charge** ($q = -e$)

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Electron (e⁻) moving north (arrow pointing up on page)
> - Force F pointing vertically upward (out of page, shown as ⊙)
> - Magnetic field B pointing west (arrow pointing left)
> - Coordinate system: North (up), South (down), East (right), West (left)

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

**Step 1: Understanding the Force Direction**

The magnetic force on a charged particle is given by:
$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

For an **electron** (negative charge), the force direction is **opposite** to what Fleming's Left Hand Rule would give for a positive charge.

**Step 2: Using Right-Hand Rule for Vector Cross Product**

The direction of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ can be found using the right-hand rule:
- Point fingers in direction of $\vec{v}$ (north)
- Curl fingers toward $\vec{B}$ direction
- Thumb points in direction of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$

**Step 3: Applying to Electron**

Since the electron experiences force **upward**, and the force for a negative charge is opposite to $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$:

- If force is **upward** (out of page, ⊙)
- Then $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ must be **downward** (into page, ⊗)
- Velocity $\vec{v}$ is **north** (upward on page)
- For $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$ to point **downward** (into page), $\vec{B}$ must point **west** (left)

**Step 4: Verification Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule (for Positive Charge)**

To verify, consider what would happen to a **positive charge**:
- If a positive charge moving **north** experiences force **downward** (into page)
- Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule:
  - **Thumb** (force): Downward (into page, ⊗)
  - **Middle finger** (velocity/current): North (upward)
  - **Forefinger** (magnetic field): Points **west** (left)

This confirms that the magnetic field is **west**.

**Step 5: Final Answer**

For an electron (negative charge) moving north with force upward, the magnetic field must be pointing **west**.

**Answer: (2) West**

### Visual Summary:

Field: ← (west, pointing left)

## Problem 9

**Question:** A vertical wire carrying a current in the upward direction is placed in a horizontal magnetic field directed towards North. The wire will experience a force directed towards

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Current direction: **Upward** (vertical)
- Magnetic field direction: **North** (horizontal)

Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule:
- **Forefinger** (magnetic field): Points **North**
- **Middle finger** (current): Points **Upward**
- **Thumb** (force): Will point **East** (perpendicular to both)

The force on the wire is perpendicular to both the current direction and the magnetic field direction. Since the field is horizontal (north) and current is vertical (up), the force will be horizontal and perpendicular to north, which is **east**.

**Answer: (1) East**

## Problem 10

**Question:** Magnetic field is produced by the flow of electric current in a straight wire. This phenomenon was discovered by

**Solution:**

The discovery that an electric current produces a magnetic field was made by **Hans Christian Oersted** in 1820. He observed that when a compass needle is placed near a current-carrying wire, the needle deflects, indicating the presence of a magnetic field around the wire.

This discovery established the connection between electricity and magnetism, leading to the field of electromagnetism.

**Answer: (2) Oersted**

## Problem 11

**Question:** When a magnetic compass needle is carried nearby to a straight wire carrying current, then

**(I)** The straight wire causes a noticeable deflection in the compass needle.  
**(II)** The alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle with straight wire as its centre and has a plane perpendicular to the wire.

**Solution:**

**Statement (I):** When a compass needle is brought near a current-carrying wire, the magnetic field produced by the current causes the compass needle to deflect. This is the fundamental observation made by Oersted. **Statement (I) is correct.**

**Statement (II):** The magnetic field lines around a straight current-carrying wire form concentric circles in a plane perpendicular to the wire. The compass needle aligns itself along the tangent to these circular field lines at its position. **Statement (II) is correct.**

Both statements are correct and describe the behavior of a compass needle near a current-carrying wire.

**Answer: (3) Both (I) and (II) are correct**

## Problem 12

**Question:** When a magnetic compass is placed in uniform magnetic field, how does the compass needle behave?

**Solution:**

A magnetic compass needle is essentially a small bar magnet. When placed in a uniform magnetic field:

- The compass needle experiences a torque that tends to align it with the magnetic field direction
- The needle will align itself so that its north pole points in the direction of the magnetic field
- In a uniform magnetic field, the needle will align itself **parallel** to the magnetic field lines
- The needle will not move randomly; it will settle in a stable position aligned with the field

**Answer: (2) The needle aligns itself parallel to magnetic field**

## Riddle

**Question:** Solve the following riddle:

> Velocity matters, direction too,  
> A force is applied, just as I move.  
> What force is this that guides my flight?

**Solution:**

The riddle describes a force that:
- Depends on velocity and direction
- Acts on a moving object
- Guides the path of motion

This describes the **magnetic force** (or **Lorentz force**) acting on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. The force is given by $F = qvB \sin \theta$ and depends on both the velocity ($v$) and its direction relative to the magnetic field.

**Answer: Magnetic force (or Lorentz force)**
