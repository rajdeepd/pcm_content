## Question 1

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:** Why does a current-carrying conductor experience force when placed in a magnetic field? State Fleming's left-hand rule.

**Solution:**

**Why a current-carrying conductor experiences force:**

A current-carrying conductor experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field because:

1. **Moving charges experience force:** Electric current is the flow of charged particles (electrons). When these charged particles move in a magnetic field, they experience a magnetic force.

2. **Force on individual charges:** Each moving charge in the conductor experiences a force given by $F = qvB \sin \theta$, where $q$ is charge, $v$ is velocity, and $B$ is magnetic field.

3. **Net force on conductor:** The sum of all individual forces on the moving charges results in a net force on the conductor.

4. **Force formula:** For a conductor of length $L$ carrying current $I$ in a magnetic field $B$, the force is: $F = BIL \sin \theta$

**Fleming's Left Hand Rule:**

If the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the **magnetic field** ($\vec{B}$)
- **Second finger** points in the direction of the **current** ($\vec{I}$)
- **Thumb** indicates the direction of the **force** ($\vec{F}$)

## Question 2

<span class="badge-cbse">(All India) CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:** Give reasons for the following:

**(a)** Magnetic field lines are crowded near the ends of a current-carrying solenoid.

**(b)** A freely suspended current-carrying solenoid rests in a particular direction.

**Solution:**

**(a) Magnetic field lines are crowded near the ends of a current-carrying solenoid:**

**Reason:**
- Inside the solenoid, magnetic field lines are **parallel and uniformly spaced**, indicating a **uniform magnetic field**.
- Near the ends of the solenoid, the field lines **diverge** (spread out) to form closed loops, similar to those of a bar magnet.
- The **density** of field lines indicates field strength - where lines are closer together, the field is stronger.
- Near the ends, field lines from inside the solenoid **converge** (come together) before diverging outward, causing them to be **crowded** (closer together).
- This crowding indicates that the magnetic field is **stronger** near the ends compared to regions far from the solenoid.

**(b) A freely suspended current-carrying solenoid rests in a particular direction:**

**Reason:**
- When current flows through a solenoid, it behaves like a **bar magnet** with one end acting as North pole and the other as South pole.
- The solenoid experiences a **torque** due to the interaction between its magnetic field and the Earth's magnetic field.
- The torque aligns the solenoid such that its magnetic axis aligns with the Earth's magnetic field direction (North-South direction).
- This is similar to how a freely suspended bar magnet aligns itself in the North-South direction.
- The solenoid will rest with its axis pointing in the **North-South direction**, just like a compass needle.

## Question 3

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:** What is the frequency of an alternating current if its direction changes after every 0.01 s?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Time for one direction change = 0.01 s

**Understanding:**
- In alternating current, the direction changes **twice** in one complete cycle (once from positive to negative, and once from negative to positive).
- Therefore, time for **one complete cycle** (period, $T$) = $2 \times 0.01$ s = $0.02$ s

**Formula:**
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

where:
- $f$ is the frequency
- $T$ is the time period

**Calculation:**
$$T = 2 \times 0.01 = 0.02 \text{ s}$$

$$f = \frac{1}{0.02} = 50 \text{ Hz}$$

**Answer:** The frequency of the alternating current is **50 Hz**.

## Question 4

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2014</span>

**Question:** State the direction of the magnetic field in the following case:

<img src="images/m-secb-q4.png" alt="Diagram showing current and force directions" width="50%">

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Current direction: **Right** (horizontal, pointing right)
- Force direction: **Upward** (vertical, pointing up)

**Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule:**
- **Thumb** (force): Points **upward**
- **Middle finger** (current): Points **right**
- **Forefinger** (magnetic field): Points **into the page** (perpendicular to both)

**Answer:** The magnetic field is directed **into the page** (or **perpendicular to the plane of the page, away from the observer**).

**Verification:**
Using the vector cross product: $\vec{F} = I(\vec{L} \times \vec{B})$
- If $\vec{L}$ is right and $\vec{F}$ is up, then $\vec{B}$ must be into the page.

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2014</span>

**Question:** Identify the type of magnetic field produced by the following diagrams and name the conductors that produce them:

<img src="images/m-secb-q5.png" alt="Magnetic field diagrams" width="50%">

**Solution:**

**(a) Non-uniform magnetic field:**

**Type of magnetic field:** **Non-uniform magnetic field** (diverging/converging field lines)

**Conductor that produces it:**
- **End of a current-carrying solenoid** (one pole - North or South)
- **Pole of a bar magnet** (North or South pole)
- **End of an electromagnet**

**Characteristics:**
- Field lines **diverge** from or **converge** towards a point
- Field strength **varies** with distance (non-uniform)
- Similar to the field pattern near a magnetic pole

**(b) Uniform magnetic field:**

**Type of magnetic field:** **Uniform magnetic field**

**Conductors that produce it:**
- **Long straight solenoid** (inside the solenoid, away from ends)
- **Between the poles of a strong horseshoe magnet**
- **Inside a toroid** (doughnut-shaped coil)

**Characteristics:**
- Field lines are **parallel, straight, and equally spaced**
- Field strength is **constant** (same magnitude and direction everywhere)
- No variation in field strength or direction

## Question 6

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2015</span>

**Question:** What is an electric fuse? What is its role? Should an electric fuse be placed on a neutral wire or a live wire? Justify your answer.

**Solution:**

**Electric Fuse:**
An electric fuse is a **safety device** made of a thin wire or strip of metal with a low melting point. It is designed to break (melt) when excessive current flows through it.

**Role of Electric Fuse:**
1. **Overcurrent protection:** It protects electrical circuits and appliances from damage due to excessive current.
2. **Short circuit protection:** It prevents fires and electrical hazards by breaking the circuit when a short circuit occurs.
3. **Overload protection:** It protects against damage when too many appliances are connected, drawing more current than the circuit can handle.
4. **Safety:** It prevents overheating of wires and potential fires.

**Placement: Live Wire or Neutral Wire?**

An electric fuse should be placed on the **live wire** (not the neutral wire).

**Justification:**

1. **Complete circuit protection:** When a fuse is placed on the live wire, breaking it disconnects the entire circuit from the power supply, ensuring complete protection.

2. **Safety:** If the fuse is on the neutral wire and it breaks, the circuit is still connected to the live wire. This means:
   - Appliances remain at high voltage potential
   - Risk of electric shock remains
   - The circuit is not truly "off"

3. **Proper isolation:** Placing the fuse on the live wire ensures that when it breaks, the entire circuit is isolated from the power source, making it safe to touch.

4. **Standard practice:** Electrical safety codes and standards require fuses to be placed on the live/hot wire for maximum safety.

**Answer:** The fuse should be placed on the **live wire** to ensure complete circuit protection and safety.

## Question 7

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2016</span>

**Question:** What is the shape of magnetic field lines around a current-carrying straight conductor?

**Solution:**

The magnetic field lines around a current-carrying straight conductor are **concentric circles**.

**Characteristics:**
1. **Shape:** The field lines form **closed circular loops** around the conductor.
2. **Center:** The conductor is at the **center** of these circles.
3. **Plane:** The circles lie in a **plane perpendicular** to the conductor.
4. **Direction:** The direction of the field lines is given by the **Right Hand Thumb Rule**:
   - Point thumb in the direction of current
   - Curled fingers show the direction of magnetic field lines
5. **Spacing:** Field lines are **closer together** near the conductor (stronger field) and **farther apart** away from the conductor (weaker field).
6. **Strength:** The magnetic field strength decreases with distance: $B \propto \frac{1}{r}$

**Answer:** The magnetic field lines are **concentric circles** centered on the conductor.

## Question 8

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:**

**(a)** State Fleming's left-hand rule.

**(b)** Write the principle of working of an electric motor.

**(c)** Explain the function of the following parts of an electric motor:
- **(i)** Armature
- **(ii)** Brushes
- **(iii)** Split ring

**Solution:**

**(a) Fleming's Left Hand Rule:**

If the forefinger, second finger, and thumb of the left hand are stretched at right angles to each other:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the **magnetic field** ($\vec{B}$)
- **Second finger** points in the direction of the **current** ($\vec{I}$)
- **Thumb** indicates the direction of the **force** ($\vec{F}$) acting on the conductor

This rule helps determine the direction of force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field.

**(b) Principle of Working of an Electric Motor:**

An electric motor works on the principle that **a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force**, which causes it to rotate.

**Detailed explanation:**
- When a rectangular coil carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, the two vertical sides experience forces in **opposite directions**.
- These forces create a **torque** (rotational force) that causes the coil to rotate.
- The **commutator** (split ring) ensures continuous rotation by reversing the current direction every half rotation.

**(c) Functions of Parts:**

**(i) Armature:**
- The **armature** is the rotating part of the motor, consisting of a coil wound on a soft iron core.
- It carries the **current** that interacts with the magnetic field.
- The armature **rotates** due to the torque produced by the interaction between current and magnetic field.
- The soft iron core **concentrates** the magnetic field, increasing the strength of interaction.

**(ii) Brushes:**
- **Brushes** are carbon or graphite blocks that maintain **sliding contact** with the rotating commutator.
- They **supply current** from the external circuit to the rotating armature coil.
- They allow the armature to rotate while maintaining **electrical contact**.
- They **transfer electrical energy** from the stationary power source to the rotating coil.

**(iii) Split Ring (Commutator):**
- The **split ring** (commutator) is a device that **reverses the direction of current** in the coil every half rotation.
- It ensures that the **torque always acts in the same direction**, causing continuous rotation.
- Without the split ring, the coil would **oscillate** back and forth instead of rotating continuously.
- It maintains **unidirectional rotation** by switching the current direction at the right moment (when the coil is vertical).

## Question 9

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:** An alpha particle enters a magnetic field at right angles to it. Explain the direction of force acting on the alpha particle using a relevant rule.

<img src="images/m-secb-q9.png" alt="Alpha particle in magnetic field" width="50%">

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Alpha particle (positively charged, $q = +2e$)
- Enters magnetic field at **right angles** ($\theta = 90°$)
- Magnetic field direction: **Upward** (vertical)
- Alpha particle direction: **Right** (horizontal, perpendicular to field)

**Using Fleming's Left Hand Rule:**

For a **positive charge** (alpha particle):
- **Thumb** (force): Will point in a direction perpendicular to both velocity and field
- **Middle finger** (current/velocity): Points **right** (direction of alpha particle)
- **Forefinger** (magnetic field): Points **upward**

**Result:**
- The force will be directed **into the page** (or **out of the page**, depending on the specific configuration)
- Since the alpha particle is moving **right** and the field is **upward**, the force is perpendicular to both, pointing **into or out of the page**

**Using Right Hand Rule for Vector Cross Product:**
- Point fingers in direction of velocity (right)
- Curl fingers toward magnetic field (upward)
- Thumb points in direction of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$
- For positive charge, force is in the direction of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$

**Answer:** The force on the alpha particle is directed **perpendicular to both the velocity and magnetic field**, pointing **into the page** (or **out of the page** depending on the specific orientation).

**Note:** The force direction can be determined precisely using Fleming's Left Hand Rule, considering that alpha particle is positively charged.

## Question 10

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2011</span>

**Question:** What is the function of a galvanometer in a circuit?

**Solution:**

**Function of a Galvanometer:**

A galvanometer is a **sensitive instrument** used to:

1. **Detect current:** It detects the presence of electric current in a circuit.
2. **Measure current:** It measures the **magnitude** (strength) of small electric currents.
3. **Determine direction:** It indicates the **direction** of current flow (whether current is flowing in one direction or the opposite).
4. **Null detection:** In some circuits (like Wheatstone bridge), it is used to detect when there is **no current** (null point).

**Working Principle:**
- A galvanometer works on the principle that a **current-carrying coil** placed in a magnetic field experiences a **torque**.
- The coil rotates, and a **pointer** attached to it indicates the current magnitude on a scale.
- The deflection is **proportional** to the current flowing through it.

**Characteristics:**
- Very **sensitive** - can detect very small currents
- Can measure current in both directions (AC or DC)
- Used in ammeters and voltmeters (when combined with appropriate resistors)

## Question 11

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2014</span>

**Question:** Two parallel straight conductors X and Y carry the same current. Copy the diagram and draw the pattern of magnetic field lines around them. Indicate the direction of magnetic field lines. What will be the magnitude of the magnetic field at an equidistant point X? Justify your answer.

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing two parallel conductors X and Y with current, and point X equidistant from both

**Solution:**

**Magnetic Field Pattern:**

When two parallel conductors carry current in the **same direction**:

1. **Field lines around each conductor:** Each conductor has **concentric circular field lines** around it.
2. **Combined pattern:** The field lines from both conductors **interact** and form a combined pattern.
3. **Between the conductors:** Field lines are **opposite** in direction, so they tend to **cancel** or form a weaker field.
4. **Outside the conductors:** Field lines are in the **same direction**, so they **reinforce** each other.

**Direction of Field Lines:**
- Using Right Hand Thumb Rule for each conductor
- The direction depends on the current direction in each conductor

**Magnitude of Magnetic Field at Equidistant Point:**

If point X is **equidistant** from both conductors and both carry the **same current** in the **same direction**:

**Answer:** The magnitude of the magnetic field at point X will be **zero** (or very small).

**Justification:**

1. **Equal and opposite fields:** At an equidistant point, the magnetic field due to conductor X and conductor Y will have **equal magnitude** but **opposite directions**.

2. **Vector addition:** Since the fields are in opposite directions, they **cancel each other out**:
   $$\vec{B}_{\text{net}} = \vec{B}_X + \vec{B}_Y = 0$$

3. **Formula:** For each conductor: $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
   - At equidistant point, $r$ is same for both
   - Current $I$ is same for both
   - Fields are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction
   - Net field = $B_X - B_Y = 0$ (since $B_X = B_Y$)

**Note:** If the currents are in **opposite directions**, the fields would be in the **same direction** and would **add up**, giving a non-zero net field.

## Question 12

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:** State the right-hand thumb rule to determine the direction of the magnetic field inside and outside a circular loop carrying current in clockwise direction.

**Solution:**

**Right Hand Thumb Rule for Circular Loop:**

**The Rule:**
- Curl the fingers of your **right hand** in the direction of **current flow** in the circular loop.
- Your **thumb** points in the direction of the **magnetic field** inside the loop.

**For a clockwise current:**

1. **Inside the loop:**
   - Curl fingers **clockwise** (as seen from above)
   - Thumb points **downward** (into the page)
   - Therefore, magnetic field inside is directed **downward** (into the page)

2. **Outside the loop:**
   - The magnetic field lines form **concentric circles** around the loop
   - The direction is **opposite** to that inside the loop
   - If inside is downward, outside field lines are directed **upward** (out of the page) around the loop

**Alternative Statement:**
- If you **grasp** the circular wire with your right hand such that your fingers curl in the direction of current, your **thumb** points in the direction of the magnetic field **inside** the loop.

**Visual Representation:**
- Clockwise current (as seen from above) → Thumb points down → Field inside is downward
- The field outside forms closed loops in the opposite direction

## Question 13

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:**

**(a)** What is a solenoid?

**(b)** Draw magnetic field lines for:
- **(i)** A current-carrying solenoid
- **(ii)** A bar magnet

**(c)** List two distinguishing features between the magnetic field of a solenoid and that of a bar magnet.

**Solution:**

**(a) Solenoid:**

A **solenoid** is a long coil of insulated wire wound closely in the form of a helix (spiral). When electric current flows through it, it produces a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet.

**Characteristics:**
- Consists of many turns of wire
- Usually wound on a cylindrical core (may be air or soft iron)
- Produces a strong, uniform magnetic field inside when current flows
- Behaves like a bar magnet with North and South poles

**(b) Magnetic Field Lines:**

**(i) Current-carrying Solenoid:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Solenoid with current-carrying coil
> - Parallel, straight field lines inside (uniform field)
> - Curved field lines outside, emerging from one end (North) and entering the other (South)
> - Field lines form closed loops

**Characteristics:**
- **Inside:** Field lines are **parallel, straight, and uniformly spaced** (uniform magnetic field)
- **Outside:** Field lines are **curved**, emerging from one end and entering the other, similar to a bar magnet
- Field is **strongest inside** the solenoid

**(ii) Bar Magnet:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Bar magnet with N and S poles labeled
> - Field lines emerging from North pole
> - Field lines entering South pole
> - Curved field lines forming closed loops
> - Field lines closer together near poles

**Characteristics:**
- Field lines emerge from the **North pole** and enter the **South pole**
- Field lines are **closer together** near the poles (stronger field)
- Field lines form **closed curves**
- Field is **strongest near the poles**

**(c) Two Distinguishing Features:**

**1. Field inside the solenoid:**
- **Solenoid:** Has a **uniform magnetic field** inside (parallel, straight, equally spaced field lines)
- **Bar magnet:** Has a **non-uniform field** - field lines are curved and not parallel inside the magnet

**2. Control of magnetic field:**
- **Solenoid:** Magnetic field can be **switched on/off** by controlling the current. Field strength can be **varied** by changing current.
- **Bar magnet:** Magnetic field is **permanent** and **cannot be switched off**. Field strength is **fixed** and cannot be varied.

**Additional distinguishing features:**
- **Solenoid:** Field strength depends on number of turns and current: $B = \mu_0 n I$
- **Bar magnet:** Field strength is fixed and depends on the magnet's material and size
- **Solenoid:** Can use soft iron core to increase field strength
- **Bar magnet:** Field is inherent to the magnetic material

## Question 14

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2019</span>

**Question:**

**(a)** What is an electromagnet? List two uses of an electromagnet.

**(b)** Draw a labeled diagram showing how an electromagnet is made.

**Solution:**

**(a) Electromagnet:**

An **electromagnet** is a temporary magnet made by winding a coil of insulated wire around a soft iron core. When electric current flows through the coil, the soft iron core becomes magnetized and behaves like a magnet. When the current is switched off, the magnetism is lost.

**Key features:**
- **Temporary:** Loses magnetism when current is switched off
- **Controllable:** Field strength can be varied by changing current
- **Strong:** Can produce very strong magnetic fields
- **Reversible:** Polarity can be reversed by reversing current direction

**Two Uses of Electromagnet:**

1. **Electric Bell:**
   - Electromagnet attracts an iron armature when current flows
   - This causes a hammer to strike a bell, producing sound
   - When the circuit breaks, the armature returns, and the process repeats

2. **Magnetic Cranes:**
   - Used in scrapyards and industries to lift and move heavy iron objects
   - When current flows, the electromagnet attracts iron objects
   - When current is switched off, objects are released
   - Allows easy handling of magnetic materials

**Other uses:**
- Loudspeakers
- Electric motors
- Relays and switches
- MRI machines
- Magnetic locks

**(b) Labeled Diagram of Electromagnet:**

> **TODO:** Add labeled diagram showing:
> - Soft iron core (cylindrical, labeled)
> - Insulated copper wire wound around the core (labeled "Coil")
> - Battery connected to the coil (labeled "Battery")
> - Switch in the circuit (labeled "Switch")
> - Direction of current indicated by arrows
> - N and S poles labeled on the iron core when current flows

**Description:**
1. **Soft iron core:** A cylindrical piece of soft iron
2. **Coil:** Insulated copper wire wound tightly around the soft iron core
3. **Circuit:** The ends of the wire are connected to a battery through a switch
4. **Working:** When the switch is closed, current flows through the coil, magnetizing the soft iron core
5. **Poles:** One end becomes North pole, the other becomes South pole
6. **Demagnetization:** When the switch is opened, current stops, and the core loses its magnetism

**Key Components:**
- **Soft iron core:** High permeability, low retentivity
- **Insulated wire:** Prevents short circuits between turns
- **Battery:** Provides electric current
- **Switch:** Controls the current flow

## Question 15

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2020</span>

**Question:**

**(i)** State the purpose of soft iron core used in making an electromagnet.

**(ii)** List two ways of increasing the strength of an electromagnet if the material of electromagnet is fixed.

**Solution:**

**(i) Purpose of soft iron core in electromagnet:**

The soft iron core is used in making an electromagnet for the following reasons:

1. **High magnetic permeability:**
   - Soft iron has **high magnetic permeability**, which means it allows magnetic field lines to pass through it easily.
   - It **concentrates** and **enhances** the magnetic field produced by the current-carrying coil.

2. **Temporary magnetization:**
   - Soft iron has **low retentivity** (low magnetic memory).
   - It becomes **strongly magnetized** when current flows through the coil.
   - It **loses magnetism quickly** when the current is switched off.
   - This makes it ideal for electromagnets that need to be switched on and off.

3. **Increases field strength:**
   - The presence of soft iron core **multiplies** the magnetic field strength by hundreds or thousands of times.
   - Without the core, the magnetic field would be much weaker.

**Answer:** The soft iron core **increases the strength of the magnetic field** and allows the electromagnet to be **easily magnetized and demagnetized**.

**(ii) Two ways to increase the strength of an electromagnet (material fixed):**

If the material of the electromagnet is fixed, the strength can be increased by:

**1. Increase the current in the coil:**
   - The magnetic field strength is **directly proportional** to the current: $B \propto I$
   - Increasing the current flowing through the coil increases the magnetic field strength.
   - Formula: $B = \mu_0 n I$ (where $I$ is current)

**2. Increase the number of turns in the coil:**
   - The magnetic field strength is **directly proportional** to the number of turns: $B \propto n$
   - More turns means more current loops contributing to the magnetic field.
   - Formula: $B = \mu_0 n I$ (where $n$ is number of turns per unit length)

**Additional methods:**
- Reduce the length of the coil (make it more compact)
- Wind the coil more tightly (reduce spacing between turns)
- Use a longer soft iron core

## Question 16

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2021</span>

**Question:** Although electric kettle and electric toaster were used simultaneously in the kitchen to prepare breakfast for the family, yet the two devices could work efficiently due to 'fuse' used in the electric circuit.

**(i)** What is a fuse? Write the material used in fuse wires. How is a fuse connected in an electric circuit?

**(ii)** State the ratings of fuse used in electric circuits.

**(iii)** What is the function of a fuse? How does it perform its function?

**(iv)** A device uses 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V. Calculate the rating of the fuse to be used.

**Solution:**

**(i) What is a fuse?**

A **fuse** is a safety device consisting of a thin wire or strip of metal with a **low melting point**. It is designed to protect electrical circuits and appliances from damage due to excessive current flow.

**Material used in fuse wires:**
- **Alloy of lead and tin** (commonly used)
- **Tin-copper alloy**
- **Aluminum**
- These materials have **low melting points** (typically around 200°C - 300°C)

**How is a fuse connected in an electric circuit?**
1. A fuse is connected in **series** with the circuit or appliance it protects.
2. It is connected to the **live wire** (phase wire), not the neutral wire.
3. It is usually placed at the **beginning** of the circuit, close to the main power supply.
4. When current flows through the circuit, it must pass through the fuse wire first.

**(ii) Ratings of fuse used in electric circuits:**

Common fuse ratings are:
- **1 A** - For low power devices (radios, lamps)
- **2 A** - For TVs, computers
- **3 A** - For mixers, fans
- **5 A** - For refrigerators, washing machines
- **10 A** - For air conditioners, electric heaters
- **13 A** - For high power appliances
- **15 A** - For heavy duty equipment
- **30 A, 32 A** - For main circuit protection

The rating depends on the **maximum current** the circuit or appliance is designed to carry safely.

**(iii) Function of a fuse and how it performs its function:**

**Function:**
1. **Overcurrent protection:** Protects circuits from excessive current due to overloading.
2. **Short circuit protection:** Prevents damage when a short circuit occurs.
3. **Fire prevention:** Prevents overheating of wires that could cause fires.
4. **Equipment protection:** Protects expensive appliances from damage.

**How it performs its function:**

1. **Normal operation:**
   - When current is within safe limits, the fuse wire remains intact.
   - It has low resistance, allowing current to flow freely.

2. **Overcurrent condition:**
   - When excessive current flows (due to overload or short circuit), the fuse wire heats up.
   - Heat generated: $H = I^2 R t$ (Joule's heating effect)
   - The temperature rises rapidly due to high current.

3. **Fuse blows:**
   - When the temperature exceeds the melting point of the fuse wire, it **melts and breaks**.
   - This **opens the circuit**, stopping current flow immediately.
   - The circuit is now protected from further damage.

4. **Circuit safety:**
   - The circuit remains open until the fuse is replaced.
   - This prevents electrical fires and equipment damage.

**(iv) Calculate the rating of the fuse to be used:**

**Given:**
- Power, $P = 1$ kW $= 1000$ W
- Voltage, $V = 220$ V

**Formula:**
$$P = VI$$

$$I = \frac{P}{V}$$

**Calculation:**
$$I = \frac{1000}{220}$$

$$I = 4.545 \text{ A}$$

**Fuse rating selection:**
- The calculated current is **4.545 A**
- A fuse should be rated slightly **higher** than the normal operating current to prevent unnecessary blowing.
- The next standard fuse rating above 4.545 A is **5 A**

**Answer:** A **5 A** fuse should be used for this device.

**Note:** The fuse rating should be:
- **Higher than** the normal operating current (to avoid frequent blowing during normal operation)
- **Lower than** the maximum current capacity of the wiring (to protect against overcurrent)

- **Pole P:** Based on the direction of field lines (entering or emerging), one pole is **North** and the other is **South**
- **Pole Q:** The opposite pole to P
- Looking at the diagram, field lines emerge from one end and enter the other
- **P = North pole** (field lines emerge from North)
- **Q = South pole** (field lines enter into South)

**Figure 'b':**
- **Pole R:** Based on the field line pattern
- **Pole S:** The opposite pole to R
- Field lines emerge from one pole and enter the other
- **R = North pole** (field lines emerge)
- **S = South pole** (field lines enter)

**Answer:**
- **Figure 'a':** P = North pole, Q = South pole (or vice versa depending on field line direction)
- **Figure 'b':** R = North pole, S = South pole (or vice versa depending on field line direction)

**Note:** The exact identification depends on the direction of field lines shown in the diagram. Magnetic field lines always emerge from the North pole and enter the South pole outside the magnet.

**(ii) Inference about the direction of the lines:**

From the diagrams, we can infer:

1. **Direction of magnetic field lines:**
   - Magnetic field lines always travel from **North pole to South pole** outside the magnet.
   - Inside the magnet, field lines travel from **South pole to North pole**.
   - Field lines form **closed loops**.

2. **Pattern observation:**
   - **Figure 'a'** shows the field pattern in a **horizontal orientation** (bar magnet lying horizontally).
   - **Figure 'b'** shows the field pattern in a **vertical orientation** (bar magnet standing vertically).
   - The field lines are **curved** and form continuous paths.

3. **General properties:**
   - Field lines **never cross** each other.
   - Field lines are **closer together** near the poles (indicating stronger field).
   - Field lines are **farther apart** away from the poles (indicating weaker field).
   - Field lines are **tangent** to the direction of the magnetic field at any point.

**Answer:** Magnetic field lines emerge from the **North pole** and enter the **South pole** outside the magnet, forming closed continuous curves that never intersect.

## Question 18

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2022</span>

**Question:** When is the force experienced by a current carrying straight conductor placed in a uniform magnetic field:

**(i)** Maximum

**(ii)** Minimum

**(iii)** Name and state the rule to determine the direction of force experienced by a current carrying straight conductor placed in a uniform magnetic field which is perpendicular to it.

**(iv)** An alpha particle while passing through a magnetic field gets projected towards north. In which direction will an electron project when it passes through the same magnetic field?

**Solution:**

**Background:**
The force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by:
$$F = BIL \sin \theta$$

where:
- $F$ = force on the conductor
- $B$ = magnetic field strength
- $I$ = current in the conductor
- $L$ = length of the conductor in the field
- $\theta$ = angle between current direction and magnetic field

**(i) Force is Maximum when:**

$$F_{\text{max}} = BIL \sin 90° = BIL$$

**Condition:** Force is maximum when $\theta = 90°$

**Answer:** The force is **maximum** when the conductor is placed **perpendicular** to the magnetic field (i.e., when the current direction is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction).

**Explanation:**
- When $\theta = 90°$, $\sin \theta = 1$ (maximum value)
- This gives maximum force: $F = BIL$

**(ii) Force is Minimum when:**

$$F_{\text{min}} = BIL \sin 0° = 0$$

**Condition:** Force is minimum (zero) when $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$

**Answer:** The force is **minimum (zero)** when the conductor is placed **parallel** to the magnetic field (i.e., when the current direction is parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field direction).

**Explanation:**
- When $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$, $\sin \theta = 0$
- This gives zero force: $F = 0$
- No force acts on the conductor when it's aligned with the field

**(iii) Rule to determine the direction of force:**

**Name:** **Fleming's Left Hand Rule**

**Statement:**
If the forefinger, middle finger, and thumb of the **left hand** are stretched mutually perpendicular to each other such that:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the **magnetic Field** (B)
- **Middle finger** points in the direction of the **Current** (I)
- Then the **Thumb** indicates the direction of the **Force** (F) or motion

**Alternative memory aid:** **FBI rule**
- **F**orefinger = **F**ield
- **M**iddle finger (second finger) = **C**urrent (**I**)
- **Th**umb = **Th**rust (Force)

**Application:**
This rule is used in:
- Determining force direction in motors
- Understanding motion of current-carrying conductors in magnetic fields
- Analyzing the working of electric motors

**(iv) Direction of electron projection:**

**Given:**
- Alpha particle (positively charged: $q = +2e$) projects towards **North**
- Same magnetic field
- Need to find: Direction of electron projection

**Analysis:**

**1. Charge comparison:**
- Alpha particle: **Positive charge** ($+2e$)
- Electron: **Negative charge** ($-e$)

**2. Force direction:**
- The force on a charged particle in a magnetic field: $\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$
- For positive charge, force is in the direction of $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$
- For negative charge, force is in the **opposite direction** to $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$

**3. Result:**
- Alpha particle (positive) → Force towards North
- Electron (negative) → Force in **opposite direction** to alpha particle
- Since alpha particle projects North, electron projects **South**

**Answer:** The electron will project towards the **South** (opposite direction to the alpha particle).

**Detailed explanation:**
- Both particles have the same velocity direction (entering the field the same way)
- Both experience the same magnetic field
- The force direction depends on the charge sign
- Since electron has **opposite charge** to alpha particle, it experiences force in the **opposite direction**
- If alpha projects **North**, electron projects **South**

**General rule:**
- Particles with **opposite charges** moving in the same magnetic field with the same velocity experience forces in **opposite directions**.

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Long cylindrical solenoid with helical coil
> - Current direction indicated with arrows
> - Inside: Parallel, straight, uniformly spaced field lines
> - Outside: Curved field lines emerging from one end (N) and entering the other (S)
> - Field lines forming closed loops
> - Labels: N pole, S pole, current direction

**Description of the pattern:**

**1. Inside the solenoid:**
- Field lines are **parallel, straight, and uniformly spaced**

- Field direction is **along the axis** of the solenoid
- Field strength is **constant** throughout the interior

**2. Outside the solenoid:**
- Field lines are **curved**
- They emerge from one end (**North pole**) of the solenoid
- They enter the other end (**South pole**) of the solenoid
- The pattern is **similar to a bar magnet**

**3. At the ends:**
- Field lines are **crowded** (closer together)

**Key features:**
- The solenoid behaves like a **bar magnet**
- One end is North pole, the other is South pole
- The magnetic field is **strongest inside** the solenoid
- Field strength: $B = \mu_0 n I$ (where $n$ = turns per unit length, $I$ = current)

## Question 20

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2022</span>

**Question:** A student fixes a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using some adhesive materials. She places a bar magnet in the centre of it and sprinkles some iron filings uniformly around the bar magnet using a salt-sprinkler. On tapping the board gently, she observes that the iron filings have arranged themselves in a particular pattern.

**(a)** Draw a diagram to show this pattern of iron filings.

**(b)** What does this pattern of iron filings demonstrate?

**(c)** How is the direction of magnetic field at a point determined using the field lines? Why do two magnetic field lines do not cross each other?

**Solution:**

**(a) Diagram showing the pattern of iron filings:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Rectangular bar magnet in the center (labeled N and S)
> - Iron filings arranged in curved lines around the magnet
> - Denser pattern near the poles
> - Lines emerging from N pole and entering S pole
> - Curved field lines forming patterns around the magnet
> - Field lines forming closed loops

**Description:**
- Iron filings align themselves along the **magnetic field lines**
- They form **curved patterns** around the bar magnet
- Pattern is **denser** (more concentrated) near the **poles**
- Pattern is **sparser** (less concentrated) away from the magnet
- Lines appear to **emerge from the North pole** and **enter the South pole**

**(b) What does this pattern of iron filings demonstrate?**

This pattern demonstrates several important properties of magnetic fields:

**1. Existence of magnetic field:**
- The iron filings pattern proves that a **magnetic field exists** around the bar magnet.
- The field is **invisible** but can be visualized using iron filings.

**2. Direction of magnetic field:**
- The pattern shows the **direction** of magnetic field lines.
- Field lines emerge from the **North pole** and enter the **South pole**.

**3. Shape of magnetic field:**
- The field lines are **curved** around the magnet.
- They form **closed loops** (though we can only see the pattern on the paper).

**4. Strength variation:**
- **Denser pattern** near the poles indicates **stronger field**.
- **Sparser pattern** away from the magnet indicates **weaker field**.
- The field strength **decreases** with distance from the magnet.

**5. Nature of magnetic field:**
- The magnetic field is **three-dimensional** (though we see a 2D pattern).
- The field extends in **all directions** around the magnet.

**Answer:** This pattern demonstrates the **presence, direction, shape, and relative strength** of the magnetic field around a bar magnet.

**(c) Two-part question:**

**Part 1: How is the direction of magnetic field determined using field lines?**

The direction of the magnetic field at any point is determined by:

**Method:**
1. Draw a **tangent** to the field line at the desired point.
2. The direction of this tangent gives the **direction of the magnetic field** at that point.

**Using a compass:**
- Place a small compass needle at the point.
- The **North pole** of the compass needle points in the direction of the magnetic field.
- This direction is **tangent** to the field line at that point.

**Convention:**
- The direction of the magnetic field is from **North pole to South pole** (outside the magnet).
- Field lines show the **path** a free North pole would follow in the field.

**Part 2: Why do two magnetic field lines not cross each other?**

Two magnetic field lines **never cross** each other. Here's why:

**Reason 1: Unique field direction**
- At any point in space, the magnetic field has a **unique direction**.
- A compass needle placed at that point can point in **only one direction**.
- If two field lines crossed, there would be **two different directions** at the crossing point, which is impossible.

**Reason 2: Mathematical explanation**
- The magnetic field at a point is a **vector quantity**.
- A vector can have only **one direction** at a given point.
- If field lines crossed, the field would have **two different directions** simultaneously, which violates basic physics.

**Reason 3: Force consideration**
- A North pole placed at the crossing point would experience forces in **two different directions**.
- This would mean the particle tries to move in **two directions at once**, which is physically impossible.

**What if they appeared to cross?**
- In 3D space, field lines may appear to cross in a 2D projection, but they actually **pass over or under** each other without actually intersecting.
- They occupy different positions in three-dimensional space.

**Answer:**
- **Direction determination:** The direction of the magnetic field at a point is given by the **tangent** to the field line at that point.
- **Why field lines don't cross:** Because the magnetic field has a **unique direction** at every point in space. If lines crossed, it would imply two different directions at the same point, which is physically impossible.

## Question 21

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2022</span>

**Question:** How are the magnetic field lines of a bar magnet drawn using a small compass needle? Draw one magnetic field line each on both sides of the magnet.

**Solution:**

**Method to draw magnetic field lines using a compass needle:**

**Procedure:**

**1. Setup:**
- Place a bar magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing board.
- Mark the outline of the magnet and label its North (N) and South (S) poles.

**2. Starting point:**
- Place a small compass needle near the **North pole** of the magnet.
- The compass needle aligns itself with the magnetic field at that point.
- Mark two points: one near the South pole of the needle and one near the North pole.

**3. Continuing the field line:**
- Move the compass so that its **South pole** coincides with the previously marked **North pole** position.
- Mark the new position of the North pole of the compass needle.
- Repeat this process, moving the compass along step by step.

**4. Completing the field line:**
- Continue until the compass needle reaches the **South pole** of the bar magnet.
- Join all the marked points with a smooth curve using a pen or pencil.
- This curve represents **one magnetic field line**.
- Draw an arrow on the line pointing from North to South pole (outside the magnet).

**5. Drawing multiple field lines:**
- Repeat the process starting from different points near the North pole.
- Draw several field lines on **both sides** of the magnet to show the complete field pattern.

**6. Properties to maintain:**
- Field lines should be **smooth curves**.
- They should **not cross** each other.
- Add **arrows** showing direction from N to S.

**Diagram showing field lines on both sides:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Bar magnet in center (labeled N and S)
> - One smooth curved field line on the RIGHT side of the magnet
> - Emerging from near the N pole, curving around, entering near S pole
> - Arrow showing direction from N to S
> - One smooth curved field line on the LEFT side of the magnet
> - Similar curve, with arrow from N to S
> - Additional field lines showing the pattern
> - Small compass needle shown at one or two positions

**Description of the field lines:**

**Right side field line:**
- Emerges from the **North pole** region
- Curves around the **right side** of the magnet
- Enters the **South pole** region
- Arrow points from **N to S**

**Left side field line:**
- Emerges from the **North pole** region
- Curves around the **left side** of the magnet
- Enters the **South pole** region
- Arrow points from **N to S**

**Key observations:**

1. **Field lines emerge** from the North pole and **enter** the South pole
2. Field lines are **closer together** near the poles (stronger field)
3. Field lines are **farther apart** away from the magnet (weaker field)
4. Field lines **never cross** each other
5. Field lines form **closed loops** (continue inside the magnet from S to N)
6. The pattern is **symmetric** on both sides of the magnet

**Important notes:**
- The compass needle always **aligns tangent** to the field line.
- The **North pole** of the compass points in the direction of the magnetic field.
- This method allows us to **map the invisible** magnetic field.

## Question 22

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** The resultant magnetic field at point '$P$' situated midway between two parallel wires (placed horizontally) each carrying a steady current $I$ is:

<img src="images/m-secb-q22.png" alt="Two parallel wires with point P" width="50%">

**(1)** in the same direction as the current in the wires.

**(2)** in the vertically upward direction.

**(3)** zero

**(4)** in the vertically downward direction.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Two parallel wires: **A-B** (top wire) and **C-D** (bottom wire)
- Both wires are placed **horizontally**
- Both carry the **same current** $I$
- Current direction: From **left to right** (A→B and C→D)
- Point **P** is situated **midway** between the two wires

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Determine the magnetic field due to each wire at point P**

Using **Right Hand Thumb Rule** (for magnetic field around a straight current-carrying conductor):
- Point thumb in the direction of **current**
- Curled fingers show the direction of **magnetic field** (circular loops)

**For wire A-B (top wire):**
- Current direction: Left to right (A→B)
- At point P (below the wire):
  - Using right hand rule: Fingers curl in a clockwise direction when viewed from the right
  - Magnetic field direction at P: **Into the page** (⊗) OR **Perpendicular into the plane**

**For wire C-D (bottom wire):**
- Current direction: Left to right (C→D)
- At point P (above the wire):
  - Using right hand rule: Fingers curl in a clockwise direction when viewed from the right
  - Magnetic field direction at P: **Out of the page** (⊙) OR **Perpendicular out of the plane**

**Step 2: Find the resultant magnetic field**

Actually, let me reconsider using the Right Hand Thumb Rule more carefully:

**For wire A-B (top wire, current left to right):**
- Grasp the wire with right hand, thumb pointing right (current direction)
- At point P (below the wire): Fingers point **into the page**
- Actually, for a point below a wire carrying current to the right, the field points **into the page**

Wait, let me use a clearer approach:

**Using Right Hand Thumb Rule for each wire:**

**Wire A-B (top wire):**
- Current: Left to right (→)
- At point P (directly below): Field direction is **downward into the page** OR looking at the vertical plane, if we consider the field in the vertical plane between the wires, the field circles the wire
- Actually, the magnetic field forms circles around the wire
- At P (below wire A-B): Field is directed **perpendicularly** 

Let me think more systematically:

**Correct Analysis:**

For a horizontal wire carrying current **to the right**:
- Below the wire: Magnetic field points **into the page** (using right-hand grip rule)
- Above the wire: Magnetic field points **out of the page**

But the question asks about the **vertical** direction (upward or downward).

**Re-analysis considering vertical component:**

When both wires carry current in the **same direction** (both left to right):

**At point P (midway between them):**

**Field due to top wire (A-B):**
- Using Right Hand Thumb Rule
- The field at P has a component in a certain direction

**Field due to bottom wire (C-D):**
- Using Right Hand Thumb Rule
- The field at P has a component in the opposite direction

Since P is **equidistant** from both wires and both carry the **same current** in the **same direction**:
- The magnetic fields due to both wires at point P have **equal magnitude**
- The fields are in **opposite directions** (perpendicular to the plane containing the wires and point P)
- They **cancel each other out**

**Result:**
$$\vec{B}_{\text{net}} = \vec{B}_{AB} + \vec{B}_{CD} = 0$$

**Answer: (3) zero**

**Explanation:**
- Both wires carry **equal currents** in the **same direction**
- Point P is **equidistant** from both wires
- The magnetic field due to wire A-B at point P has magnitude $B_1 = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
- The magnetic field due to wire C-D at point P has magnitude $B_2 = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ (same as $B_1$)
- These fields are in **opposite directions** (one into the page, one out of the page)
- Vector sum: $B_{\text{net}} = B_1 - B_2 = 0$

**Physical interpretation:**
- When two parallel wires carry current in the same direction, the magnetic field cancels at the midpoint
- The resultant field is **zero** at point P

**Important note:**
- If the currents were in **opposite directions**, the fields would **add up** (be in the same direction)
- The resultant would then be **non-zero** and in the vertical direction

## Question 23

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** There are two statements: Assertion(A) and Reason (R). Answer these questions selecting the appropriate option given below.

**Assertion (A):** The strength of the magnetic field produced at the center of a current carrying circular coil increases on increasing the number of turns in it.

**Reason (R):** The current in each circular turn has the same direction and the magnetic field due to each turn then just adds up.

**(1)** Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).

**(2)** Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).

**(3)** (A) is true, but (R) is false.

**(4)** (A) is false, but (R) is true.

**Solution:**

**Analyzing Assertion (A):**

The magnetic field at the center of a current-carrying circular coil is given by:
$$B = \frac{\mu_0 n I}{2r}$$

where:
- $B$ = magnetic field at the center
- $\mu_0$ = permeability of free space
- $n$ = number of turns
- $I$ = current
- $r$ = radius of the coil

From this formula, we can see that:
- $B \propto n$ (magnetic field is directly proportional to number of turns)
- **Increasing the number of turns** increases the magnetic field strength

**Conclusion:** Assertion (A) is **TRUE**.

**Analyzing Reason (R):**

When a circular coil has multiple turns:
1. **Current direction:** The current in each turn flows in the **same direction** (either all clockwise or all counterclockwise when viewed from one side).

2. **Field direction:** Using the Right Hand Thumb Rule, each turn produces a magnetic field in the **same direction** at the center.

3. **Superposition principle:** The total magnetic field is the **vector sum** of fields from all turns.

4. **Addition of fields:** Since all fields are in the **same direction**, they **add up** algebraically:
   $$B_{\text{total}} = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + ... + B_n$$

**Conclusion:** Reason (R) is **TRUE**.

**Is (R) the correct explanation of (A)?**

Yes! Reason (R) correctly explains **WHY** the field increases when we increase the number of turns:
- Each turn contributes a magnetic field
- All these fields are in the same direction
- Therefore, they add up
- More turns → more fields adding up → stronger total field

**Answer: (1) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).**

**Key concepts:**
- Magnetic field at center of circular coil: $B = \frac{\mu_0 n I}{2r}$
- Multiple turns create additive fields in the same direction
- This is the principle behind electromagnets and solenoids

## Question 24

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:**

**(i)** State the rule used to find the force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field.

**(ii)** Given below are three diagrams showing entry of an electron in a magnetic field. Identify the case in which the force will be (1) maximum and (2) minimum respectively. Give reason for your answer.

<img src="images/m-secb-q24.png" alt="Three cases of electron in magnetic field" width="50%">

**Solution:**

**(i) Rule to find the force:**

**Name:** **Fleming's Left Hand Rule**

**Statement:**
Stretch the forefinger, middle finger, and thumb of your **left hand** mutually perpendicular to each other such that:
- **Forefinger** points in the direction of the magnetic **Field** (B)
- **Middle finger** points in the direction of the **Current** (I)
- **Thumb** indicates the direction of the **Force** (F) or motion

**For electrons:**
Since electrons are negatively charged, the force direction is **opposite** to what Fleming's Left Hand Rule predicts for conventional current.

**Alternative:** Use the formula:
$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

For negative charge (electron), the force is opposite to the cross product direction.

**(ii) Maximum and minimum force cases:**

**Formula for force on a charged particle:**
$$F = qvB \sin \theta$$

where:
- $q$ = charge of electron
- $v$ = velocity of electron
- $B$ = magnetic field strength
- $\theta$ = angle between velocity and magnetic field

**Analysis of three cases:**

**Case (i): Electron moving upward, field pointing right**
- Velocity: Upward (↑)
- Magnetic field: Right (→)
- Angle between v and B: $\theta = 90°$
- Force: $F = qvB \sin 90° = qvB$ (maximum)

**Case (ii): Electron moving right, field pointing right**
- Velocity: Right (→)
- Magnetic field: Right (→)
- Angle between v and B: $\theta = 0°$
- Force: $F = qvB \sin 0° = 0$ (minimum)

**Case (iii): Electron moving right, field into the page**
- Velocity: Right (→)
- Magnetic field: Into page (⊗)
- Angle between v and B: $\theta = 90°$
- Force: $F = qvB \sin 90° = qvB$ (maximum)

**Answer:**

**(1) Maximum force:** Cases **(i) and (iii)** - when velocity is **perpendicular** to the magnetic field ($\theta = 90°$)

**(2) Minimum force:** Case **(ii)** - when velocity is **parallel** to the magnetic field ($\theta = 0°$)

**Reason:**
- Force is maximum when $\sin \theta = 1$, which occurs when $\theta = 90°$ (perpendicular)
- Force is minimum (zero) when $\sin \theta = 0$, which occurs when $\theta = 0°$ or $180°$ (parallel or antiparallel)

**General principle:**
- **Perpendicular motion:** Maximum force (deflection occurs)
- **Parallel motion:** Zero force (no deflection)
- **Any other angle:** Force = $qvB \sin \theta$ (intermediate value)

## Question 25

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:**

**(i)** Draw the pattern of magnetic field lines of:

## Question 26

<img src="images/m-secb-q26.png" alt="Electron and positron in uniform magnetic field" width="50%">

**(1)** both pointing into the plane of the paper.

**(2)** both pointing out of the plane of the paper.

**(3)** pointing into the plane of the paper and out of the plane of the paper respectively.

**(4)** pointing out of the plane of the paper and into the plane of the paper respectively.

**Solution:**

**Given information:**
- Uniform magnetic field in the **plane of paper** (horizontal, pointing right →)
- **Electron** ($e^-$): Negative charge, entering from left
- **Positron** ($p^+$): Positive charge (antiparticle of electron), entering from left
- Both particles moving in the **same direction** (likely horizontally to the right)

**Formula for force on a charged particle:**
$$\vec{F} = q(\vec{v} \times \vec{B})$$

where:
- $q$ = charge of particle
- $\vec{v}$ = velocity vector
- $\vec{B}$ = magnetic field vector

**Analysis:**

**From the diagram:**
- Magnetic field: Horizontal, pointing **right** (→)
- Electron velocity: **Downward** (↓)
- Positron velocity: **Upward** (↑) - opposite to electron

Note: The electron and positron are moving in **opposite directions**.

**For the Electron ($e^-$):**
- Charge: $q = -e$ (negative)
- Velocity: Downward (↓)
- Magnetic field: Right (→)
- Using right-hand rule for $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$:
  - Point fingers downward (velocity)
  - Curl toward right (field)
  - Thumb points: **Out of the page** (⊙)
- But electron is negative, so force is **opposite**: **Into the page** (⊗)

**For the Positron ($p^+$):**
- Charge: $q = +e$ (positive)
- Velocity: **Upward** (↑)
- Magnetic field: Right (→)
- Using right-hand rule for $\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$:
  - Point fingers **upward** (velocity)
  - Curl toward right (field)
  - Thumb points: **Into the page** (⊗)
- Positron is positive, so force is in this direction: **Into the page** (⊗)

**Result:**
- Electron: Force **into the plane** (⊗)
- Positron: Force **into the plane** (⊗)

**Answer: (1) both pointing into the plane of the paper.**

**Explanation:**
- Electron and positron have **opposite charges** ($-e$ and $+e$)
- They are moving in **opposite directions** (downward and upward)
- In a magnetic field pointing right, both experience forces **into the page**
- The combination of opposite charges AND opposite velocities results in forces in the **same direction**

**Key concept:**
When particles with opposite charges move in opposite directions through the same magnetic field, the two "opposite" effects cancel out, resulting in forces in the **same direction**.

## Question 28

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** What is the shape of the magnetic field produced by a current carrying straight conductor? State the rule to find the direction of this field.

**Solution:**

**Shape of the magnetic field:**

The magnetic field produced by a current-carrying straight conductor consists of **concentric circles**.

**Detailed description:**

1. **Shape:** **Concentric circular loops** (circles within circles)

2. **Center:** The **conductor** is at the center of all these circles

3. **Plane:** The circles lie in **planes perpendicular** to the conductor

4. **Size:** Circles have **different radii** - larger circles farther from the wire

5. **Spacing:** 
   - Field lines are **closer together** near the conductor (stronger field)
   - Field lines are **farther apart** away from the conductor (weaker field)

6. **Field strength:** 
   - Decreases with distance from the conductor
   - Formula: $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ (inversely proportional to distance)

**Rule to find the direction of the field:**

**Name:** **Right Hand Thumb Rule** (also called Maxwell's Corkscrew Rule or Right Hand Grip Rule)

**Statement:**

**Method 1: Right Hand Thumb Rule**
- Imagine holding the current-carrying conductor in your **right hand**
- Point your **thumb** in the direction of the **current**
- Your **curled fingers** show the direction of the **magnetic field lines**

**Method 2: Maxwell's Corkscrew Rule (Alternative statement)**
- Imagine driving a right-handed corkscrew (or screw) in the direction of current
- The direction in which the handle of the corkscrew rotates gives the direction of magnetic field lines

**Application:**

**For conventional current flowing:**

**Upward (↑):**
- Field lines are **counterclockwise** when viewed from above
- Field direction: ⟲ (anticlockwise from top)

**Downward (↓):**
- Field lines are **clockwise** when viewed from above
- Field direction: ⟳ (clockwise from top)

**To the right (→):**
- Above the wire: Field points **into the page** (⊗)
- Below the wire: Field points **out of the page** (⊙)

**Visual representation:**

If current flows from bottom to top (↑):
- Looking from top: Magnetic field circles are **counterclockwise**
- At the front of wire: Field points **left** (←)
- At the back of wire: Field points **right** (→)

**Summary:**
- **Shape:** Concentric circles around the conductor
- **Rule:** Right Hand Thumb Rule (thumb = current, fingers = field direction)
- **Field strength:** $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$ (decreases with distance)

## Question 29

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

**Question:** Define the term solenoid. Draw the pattern of magnetic field lines around a current carrying solenoid. State how this magnetic field can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material like soft iron.

**Solution:**

**Definition of Solenoid:**

A **solenoid** is a long coil of insulated copper wire wound closely in the form of a **helix** (spiral), usually in the shape of a cylinder. When electric current flows through it, it produces a magnetic field similar to that of a bar magnet.

**Characteristics:**
- **Many turns** of wire (typically hundreds or thousands)
- Turns are **closely wound** and **evenly spaced**
- Usually **cylindrical** in shape
- Made of **insulated wire** to prevent short circuits between turns
- Length is usually much **greater than diameter**

**Pattern of magnetic field lines:**

> **TODO:** Add diagram showing:
> - Cylindrical solenoid with helical coil
> - Current direction shown with arrows in the coil
> - Inside: Parallel, straight, uniformly spaced field lines (showing uniform field)
> - Outside: Curved field lines emerging from one end (N pole) and entering other end (S pole)
> - Field lines forming closed loops
> - Labels: North pole, South pole, Current direction
> - Arrows on field lines showing direction (N to S outside)

**Description of field pattern:**

**Inside the solenoid:**
- Field lines are **parallel, straight, and uniformly spaced**
- Indicates **uniform magnetic field**
- Field is directed **along the axis** of the solenoid
- Field is **strongest** inside
- Formula: $B = \mu_0 n I$ (where $n$ = turns per unit length)

**Outside the solenoid:**
- Field lines are **curved**
- Pattern is **similar to a bar magnet**
- Lines **emerge** from one end (**North pole**)
- Lines **enter** the other end (**South pole**)
- Field is **weaker** outside compared to inside

**At the ends (poles):**
- Field lines are **crowded** (denser)
- Field is **stronger** near the poles
- One end behaves as **North pole**, other as **South pole**

**Determining pole direction:**
Use **Right Hand Thumb Rule:**
- Curl fingers of right hand in the direction of **current flow** in the coil
- **Thumb** points toward the **North pole** of the solenoid

**How the magnetic field can be used to magnetize soft iron:**

**Method:**

1. **Insert soft iron core:**
   - Place a soft iron rod **inside the solenoid** along its axis
   - The rod should extend through the length of the solenoid

2. **Pass current:**
   - When current flows through the solenoid, a strong magnetic field is produced inside
   - The field is uniform: $B = \mu_0 n I$

3. **Magnetization process:**
   - The **magnetic domains** in soft iron (randomly oriented initially) align with the external magnetic field
   - All domains align in the **same direction** as the solenoid's field
   - The soft iron becomes **magnetized**
   - The iron core now has its own **North and South poles**

4. **Enhanced field:**
   - The magnetized iron core **increases** the total magnetic field
   - The iron's high **permeability** concentrates the field lines
   - Total field can be **hundreds or thousands of times** stronger

5. **Electromagnet formation:**
   - The combination of solenoid + magnetized iron core = **Electromagnet**
   - Very strong magnetic field
   - Can attract iron objects, lift heavy loads, etc.

**Why soft iron is used:**

**Advantages of soft iron:**

1. **High permeability:**
   - Easily allows magnetic field lines to pass through
   - Greatly amplifies the magnetic field

2. **Low retentivity:**
   - Loses magnetism quickly when current is stopped
   - Ideal for **temporary magnets** (electromagnets)
   - Can be switched on/off easily

3. **Easy magnetization:**
   - Gets magnetized easily in the presence of external field
   - Requires less energy to magnetize

4. **Reversible:**
   - Polarity can be reversed by reversing current
   - Flexible and controllable

**Demagnetization:**
- When current is **switched off**, the magnetic field disappears
- Soft iron **loses its magnetism** quickly
- Returns to unmagnetized state (randomly oriented domains)

**Applications:**
- **Electric bells** - electromagnet attracts armature
- **Magnetic cranes** - lift heavy iron objects
- **Electric motors** - create rotating magnetic fields
- **Relays and switches** - electromagnetic switching
- **MRI machines** - strong controlled magnetic fields

**Summary:**
- **Solenoid:** Long helical coil producing bar magnet-like field
- **Field pattern:** Uniform inside, bar magnet-like outside
- **Magnetization:** Insert soft iron → Pass current → Iron domains align → Strong electromagnet formed
- **Advantages:** Controllable, strong, reversible magnetism
