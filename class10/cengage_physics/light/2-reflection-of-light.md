## 2. Reflection of Light

**Reflection** is defined as the **bouncing back of light rays into the same medium** when those rays strike a surface or a boundary separating two media. When light falls on an object, it may be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected, depending on the nature of the medium.

* **Reflecting Surfaces:** Some surfaces reflect most of the incident light, such as a polished silver mirror.

### Key Terms and Definitions

* **Incident Ray:** The ray of light which strikes a surface.
* **Point of Incidence (O):** The point at which the incident ray falls on the reflecting surface.
* **Reflected Ray:** The ray of light which is bounced back by the reflecting surface.
* **Normal (ON):** A line drawn **perpendicular** to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence.
* **Angle of Incidence ($i$):** The angle made by the incident ray with the normal, always measured with respect to the normal.
* **Angle of Reflection ($r$):** The angle made by the reflected ray with the normal, always measured with respect to the normal.
* **Object:** Anything that gives out light, either by itself or after reflection.
    * **Real Image:** Formed by the **actual intersection** of light rays and **can be obtained on a screen** (e.g., image on a cinema screen).
    * **Virtual Image:** Formed when the rays of light **appear to meet** at some point, but do not actually intersect. It **cannot be obtained on a screen** (e.g., image in a plane mirror of a real object).
* **Plane Mirror:** A plane glass sheet with a silvered surface protected by paint.

## 2.1 Laws of Reflection

Reflection takes place according to definite laws:

1.  **First Law of Reflection:** The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal drawn to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, **all lie in the same plane**.
2.  **Second Law of Reflection:** The **angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection** ($i=r$).

### Types of Reflection
* **Regular Reflection:** When a parallel beam of light is incident on a **plane, highly polished surface**, the reflected beam remains **parallel**, reflecting light in a definite direction.
* **Irregular (Diffuse) Reflection:** When a parallel beam of light is incident on a **rough or irregular surface**, the rays are reflected in **all directions**, spreading the light over a wide area.

## 2.2 Concepts

### Example 1 (Laws of Reflection)
**Problem:** Which diagram correctly shows two different rays being reflected from the same mirror point?  

<img src="./images/light-fig3.png" width="100%"/>

**Solution:** Only Diagram 1 is correct, because the law of reflection ($\angle i = \angle r$) must hold true for **every single ray** reflected from the surface.

### Example 2 (Types of Reflection)
**Observation:** Smooth areas of a lake appear pink (sunset light), while rippled areas appear blue (sky light).     
**Solution:**
* The **smooth areas** show **specular reflection** (regular), reflecting the direct pink light of the sunset.
* The **rippled areas** show **diffuse reflection** (irregular), scattering light from all parts of the sky. Since most of the sky is blue, these areas appear blue.

### NCERT PLUS: Reflection at Plane Surfaces
* **Image Characteristics:** The image formed by a plane mirror is always **erect, virtual, of the same size**, and is at the **same distance behind the mirror** as the object is in front of it.
      <img src="./images/light-fig4.png" width="60%"/>

* **Lateral Inversion:** The image is a front-back reversal of the object (left appears right).
* **Angle of Deviation ($\delta$):** The deviation of the reflected ray with respect to the incident ray is given by the formula:
  <img src="./images/light-fig5.png" width="60%"/>

    $
    \delta = 180^{\circ} - 2i
    $
* For **normal incidence** ($\angle i = 0$), the deviation is **maximum** ($180^{\circ}$), as the ray is reflected back along the same path.
    <img src="./images/light-fig6.png" width="60%"/>


* **Effect of mirror rotation**: 
    * when the mirror is rotated through an angle $\mathbf{\theta}$, the **normal to the mirror rotates through an angle $\mathbf{\theta}$** from the initial position.
    * the angle of incidence changes to $\theta$.
    * the **reflected ray** makes an angle $\mathbf{2 \theta}$ with the original reflected ray.
  
    <img src="./images/light-fig7.png" width="60%"/>

* **Image formation by a plane mirror**

    * the line joining the object and the image formed by a plane mirror is always **perpendicular to the surface of the mirror**.
    * though every part of a mirror forms a complete image of an object, we usually see only that part of it from which light after reflection from the mirror reaches our eye.

   

* **Deviation by two inclined mirrors**

    * if two mirrors are inclined at an angle $\mathbf{\theta}$ with each other, a ray suffers a **net deviation** $\mathbf{\delta}$.
    * the formula for the net deviation is: $\mathbf{\delta=360^{\circ}-2 \theta}$.
    * the deviation produced by the $1^{\text{st }}$ mirror is $\delta_1=180^{\circ}-2 \alpha$.
    * the deviation produced by the $2^{\text{nd }}$ mirror is $\delta_2=180^{\circ}-2 \beta$.
  
  <img src="./images/light-fig8.png" width="60%"/>

* **Derivation of net deviation $\mathbf{\delta}$:**
    * net deviation $\delta = \delta_1+\delta_2$
    * $\delta = 360^{\circ}-2(\alpha+\beta)$
    * since $\mathbf{\theta=\alpha+\beta}$ (from the geometry of the inclined mirrors)
    * $\therefore \text { net deviation } \mathbf{\delta} = \mathbf{360^{\circ}-2 \theta}$
  
  <img src="./images/light-fig9.png" width="60%"/>

* If two plane mirrors are inclined at $90^{\circ}$ to each other, the final reflected ray is always antiparallel to incident ray if it suffers one reflection from each of the mirrors i.e. $\delta=360^{\circ}-2 \times 90^{\circ}=180^{\circ}$

  <img src="./images/light-fig6.1.png" width="70%"/>

### Example 3 (Two Inclined Mirrors)
**Problem:** Two mirrors are inclined at $120^{\circ}$. A ray is incident on $M_1$ at $65^{\circ}$ to the normal. Find the direction of the ray after reflection from $M_2$.
<img src="./images/light-fig12.png" width="60%"/>

**Solution :** Applying the law of reflection at $M_1$ ($65^{\circ}$ reflection) and using the $120^{\circ}$ mirror angle for geometric calculation, the final reflected ray makes an angle of $\mathbf{55^{\circ}}$ with the normal to $M_2$.


### Example 4 (Two Inclined Mirrors)
**Problem:** Two mirrors are inclined at $70^{\circ}$. A ray $PO$ incident on $M_1$ is reflected parallel to $M_1$ after reflection from $M_2$. Find the angle of incidence $\angle i$ on $M_1$.


  <img src="./images/light-fig13.png" width="60%"/>

**Solution :** By using the condition that the final reflected ray is parallel to the first mirror ($M_1$), and applying the properties of reflection within the $70^{\circ}$ triangle, the required angle of incidence $\angle i$ on $M_1$ is $\mathbf{50^{\circ}}$.

### Example 5 (Rotating Mirror)
**Problem:** A plane mirror is inclined at angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. A ray incident at $10^{\circ}$ above horizontal becomes **vertical** after reflection. Find $\theta$.


  <img src="./images/light-fig15.png" width="60%"/>

**Solution:** 


  <img src="./images/light-fig16.png" width="60%"/>

By setting up the geometric relationship between the incident ray ($10^{\circ}$), the reflected ray ($90^{\circ}$ vertical), and the angle of the mirror ($\theta$) such that $\angle i = \angle r$, the resulting angle of mirror inclination is $\mathbf{\theta = 50^{\circ}}$.

Here are the details for **Example 7** and **Example 8** from the Reflection section.

### Example 7 (Number of Images Formed)

**Problem:** The number of images formed of a bulb placed between two plane mirrors inclined at an angle of $60^{\circ}$ will be?

**Solution:**
1.  Calculate the factor $m$:
    $$
    m = \frac{360^{\circ}}{\theta} = \frac{360^{\circ}}{60^{\circ}} = 6
    $$
2.  Since $m$ is an **even integer** (6), the number of images ($n$) is found by:
    $$
    n = m - 1 = 6 - 1 = \mathbf{5} \text{ images}
    $$

***

### Example 8 (Angle of Deviation)

**Problem:** A ray of light is incident on a plane mirror at an angle of $30^{\circ}$. What is the angle of deviation of this ray?

**Solution:**
1.  The angle of deviation ($\delta$) for a single reflection from a plane surface is given by the formula:
    $$
    \delta = 180^{\circ} - 2i
    $$
2.  Substitute the angle of incidence ($i = 30^{\circ}$):
    $$
    \delta = 180^{\circ} - 2(30^{\circ}) = 180^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = \mathbf{120^{\circ}}
    $$
