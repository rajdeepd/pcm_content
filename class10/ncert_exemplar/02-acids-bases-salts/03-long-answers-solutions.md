# Unit 2: Long Answer Solutions

43. **Changes in Hydrogen Prep (Zn + \(H_2SO_4\)):**
    - (a) **Zinc dust:** The reaction will occur faster because zinc dust has a larger surface area than granules.
    - (b) **Dilute HCl:** The result will be same as \(H_2SO_4\); hydrogen gas will still be evolved.
    - (c) **Copper turnings:** No reaction will occur as copper is less reactive than hydrogen and cannot displace it from acids.
    - (d) **NaOH + Heat:** Zinc reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium zincate and hydrogen gas.
      \[Zn + 2NaOH \rightarrow Na_2ZnO_2 + H_2\]

44. **Cake with Baking Soda:**
    - (a) **Effect on taste:** The cake will have a bitter taste. This is due to the formation of sodium carbonate (\(Na_2CO_3\)) when baking soda is heated.
    - (b) **Conversion:** Baking soda can be converted to baking powder by adding a mild edible acid like tartaric acid.
    - (c) **Role of Tartaric acid:** It neutralizes the basic sodium carbonate formed during the reaction, removing the bitterness and producing pleasant-tasting sodium tartrate.

45. **Identification (X, Y, G, Z):**
    - **X:** Calcium carbonate (\(CaCO_3\)).
    - **Y:** Calcium hydroxide (Lime water, \(Ca(OH)_2\)).
    - **G:** Chlorine (\(Cl_2\)).
    - **Z:** Bleaching powder (\(CaOCl_2\)).
    **Logic:** \(CaCO_3\) + acid → \(CO_2\). \(CO_2\) passed through \(Ca(OH)_2\) (Y) gives \(CaCO_3\) (X) back. Chlorine (G) from brine passed over dry slaked lime (Y) gives bleaching powder (Z).

46. **Base B (Sodium Hydroxide):**
    - **Identification:** B is Sodium hydroxide (\(NaOH\)). It is a by-product of the chlor-alkali process and is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture and becomes sticky).
    - **Reaction with acidic oxide:** It undergoes a neutralization reaction.
    - **Equation:** \[2NaOH + CO_2 \rightarrow Na_2CO_3 + H_2O\]

47. **Sulphate Salt (Plaster of Paris):**
    - **Identification:** The salt is Calcium sulphate hemihydrate (\(CaSO_{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2}H_{2}O\)), commonly known as Plaster of Paris.
    - **Behaviour:** When POP is left in open, it absorbs moisture from the air and re-hydrates to form Gypsum, a hard solid mass.
    - **Reaction:** \[CaSO_4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}H_2O + 1\frac{1}{2}H_2O \rightarrow CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O\]

48. **Identification (X, A, B, C):**
    - **X:** Sodium hydroxide (\(NaOH\)).
    - **A:** Sodium zincate (\(Na_2ZnO_2\)).
    - **B:** Sodium chloride (\(NaCl\)).
    - **C:** Sodium acetate (\(CH_3COONa\)).
    **Equations:**
    - \(Zn + 2NaOH \rightarrow Na_2ZnO_2 + H_2\)
    - \(HCl + NaOH \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O\)
    - \(CH_3COOH + NaOH \rightarrow CH_3COONa + H_2O\)
