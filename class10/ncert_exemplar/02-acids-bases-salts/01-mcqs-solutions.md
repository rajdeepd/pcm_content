# Unit 2: MCQ Solutions

1. **Answer: (d)**
   **Explanation:** The reaction between an acid and a base is a neutralization reaction. It is an exothermic process, so the temperature of the solution increases (i). The products of neutralization are salt and water (iv).

2. **Answer: (d)**
   **Explanation:** A solution that turns red litmus blue is basic. To reverse this change (turn blue litmus back to red), an acid must be added in excess. Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid.

3. **Answer: (c)**
   **Explanation:** Calcium chloride (\(CaCl_2\)) is a well-known drying agent. It is used in the guard tube to absorb moisture from the hydrogen chloride gas, especially on humid days.

4. **Answer: (b)**
   **Explanation:** 
   - Blue vitriol is \(CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O\)
   - Washing soda is \(Na_2CO_3 \cdot 10H_2O\)
   - Gypsum is \(CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O\)
   - Baking soda is \(NaHCO_3\), which does not contain water of crystallisation.

5. **Answer: (d)**
   **Explanation:** Sodium carbonate (\(Na_2CO_3\)) is the salt of a weak acid (Carbonic acid, \(H_2CO_3\)) and a strong base (Sodium hydroxide, \(NaOH\)). Salts of weak acids and strong bases are basic in nature.

6. **Answer: (a)**
   **Explanation:** Calcium phosphate [\(Ca_3(PO_4)_2\)] is a salt of a strong base (Calcium hydroxide) and a weak acid (Phosphoric acid). It is basic in nature.

7. **Answer: (d)**
   **Explanation:** Yellowish-orange color on pH paper indicates an acidic sample. Greenish-blue color indicates a basic solution. Therefore, a base or an antacid (which is basic) should be added.

8. **Answer: (a)**
   **Explanation:** Water is neutral. Acetic acid is a weak organic acid. Hydrochloric acid is a strong mineral acid. Order: Water < Acetic acid < Hydrochloric acid.

9. **Answer: (b)**
   **Explanation:** Immediate washing with plenty of water dilutes the acid. Applying a paste of a mild base like baking soda (\(NaHCO_3\)) helps neutralize the remaining acid without being corrosive itself.

10. **Answer: (b)**
    **Explanation:** The reaction between acetic acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate produces carbon dioxide gas (\(CO_2\)). \(CO_2\) turns lime water milky (i), extinguishes a burning splinter (ii), and reacts with \(NaOH\) to form sodium carbonate (iii). It is odourless.

11. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** Sodium chloride (common salt) is a raw material for the manufacture of washing soda (\(Na_2CO_3\)) and baking soda (\(NaHCO_3\)). Bleaching powder is made from slaked lime and chlorine.

12. **Answer: (b)**
    **Explanation:** Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda (\(NaHCO_3\)) and a mild edible acid like tartaric acid.

13. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** Bacteria in the mouth produce acids by degrading sugar. Toothpaste is basic to neutralize these acids and prevent tooth decay.

14. **Answer: (d)**
    **Explanation:** 
    - pH scale ranges from 0-14. 
    - 0-7 is acidic (lower pH = stronger acid).
    - 7-14 is basic (higher pH = stronger base).
    - Thus, higher pH means weaker acid (ii) and lower pH means weaker base (iv).

15. **Answer: (a)**
    **Explanation:** Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid (\(HCl\)), making its pH less than 7 (usually around 1.2 to 2.0).

16. **Answer: (b)**
    **Explanation:** Adding acid to water results in the formation of ions (Ionisation) and reduces the concentration of ions per unit volume (Dilution). Neutralization and salt formation require a base.

17. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** Vanilla essence is an olfactory indicator. Its characteristic smell changes in the presence of an acid or a base, making it suitable for visually impaired students.

18. **Answer: (d)**
    **Explanation:** Metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates (Marble, Limestone, Baking soda) react with acids to give \(CO_2\). Lime (Calcium oxide, \(CaO\)) is a metal oxide and does not give \(CO_2\).

19. **Answer: (a)**
    **Explanation:** Lime juice contains citric acid. Human blood is slightly basic (~7.4), Lime water is basic [\(Ca(OH)_2\)], and Antacids are basic.

20. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** \(NaOH\) is a strong base that dissociates completely into \(Na^+\) and \(OH^-\) ions in aqueous solution, which conduct electricity and cause the bulb to glow.

21. **Answer: (d)**
    **Explanation:** Aqua regia is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio 3:1. It can dissolve noble metals like gold and platinum.

22. **Answer: (b)**
    **Explanation:** Citric acid is an organic acid found in citrus fruits. The others are mineral acids derived from inorganic minerals.

23. **Answer: (d)**
    **Explanation:** Ethanol (\(C_2H_5OH\)) is an alcohol. Although it has an \(-OH\) group, it does not ionise to give \(OH^-\) ions in water and is not a base.

24. **Answer: (b)**
    **Explanation:** Metal oxides are generally basic. They react with water to form bases (alkalis), not acids. Non-metal oxides react with water to form acids.

25. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** 
    - Bleaching powder: Decolourisation (iii)
    - Baking soda: Antacid (iv)
    - Washing soda: Preparation of glass (i)
    - Sodium chloride: Production of \(H_2\) and \(Cl_2\) (ii)

26. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** Mixing equal volumes of strong acid (\(HCl\)) and strong base (\(NaOH\)) of the same concentration results in a neutral solution (pH = 7). The pH paper color for neutral is yellowish-green.

27. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** \(HCl\) gas is covalent but ionises in the presence of water (ii). It forms hydronium ions (\(H_3O^+\)) as the released \(H^+\) ions combine with water molecules (iv).

28. **Answer: (c)**
    **Explanation:** Acids are sour in taste and turn blue litmus red. Bases are bitter and turn red litmus blue.

29. **Answer: (a)**
    **Explanation:** In aqueous solution, \(HCl\) dissociates into \(H^+\) and \(Cl^-\). The \(H^+\) ion immediately combines with a water molecule to form the hydronium ion (\(H_3O^+\)).

30. **Answer: (d)**
    **Explanation:** In the chlor-alkali process, an aqueous solution of sodium chloride [\(NaCl(aq)\)] reacts with liquid water [\(H_2O(l)\)] to produce aqueous sodium hydroxide [\(NaOH(aq)\)], chlorine gas [\(Cl_2(g)\)], and hydrogen gas [\(H_2(g)\)].
