# 1.4 Effects of Oxidation in Everyday Life

## Corrosion

- Slow eating away of metal surfaces by air, water, or chemicals.  
- Rusting of iron is a redox reaction; similar coatings form on silver (black) and copper (green).
- Effects: wastage of metals; damage to car bodies, bridges, railings, ships, etc.; costly replacements.
- Note: For aluminium, corrosion is not considered wasteful.

### Prevention

- Painting, galvanising, electroplating.

## Rancidity

- Slow oxidation of fats/oils in food, causing bad smell/taste.
- Prevention methods:
  - Keep food in airtight containers.
  - Refrigerate cooked food.
  - Pack chips/foods in nitrogen instead of air.
  - Add antioxidants to fatty foods.

## Try These 1.2

1) Identify the type of reaction:  
   (i) $\mathrm{CH}_4(g)+2\mathrm{O}_2(g) \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2(g)+2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(g)$  
   (ii) $2\mathrm{NaCl}(l) \xrightarrow{\text{Electric current}} 2\mathrm{Na}(s)+\mathrm{Cl}_2(g)$  
   (iii) $\mathrm{MnO}_2+4\mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{MnCl}_2+2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Cl}_2$
2) Give an example of photochemical decomposition.  
3) Give an example of a double displacement reaction that is also neutralisation.  
4) Is decomposition of calcium carbonate exothermic or endothermic?

### Answers (Try These 1.2)

1) (i) Combustion/oxidation (exothermic)  
   (ii) Electrolytic decomposition (electrolysis)  
   (iii) Redox reaction (HCl oxidised, MnO₂ reduced)  
2) Example: $2\text{AgCl} \xrightarrow{\text{sunlight}} 2\text{Ag} + \text{Cl}_2$  
3) Neutralisation/double displacement: $ \text{NaOH} + \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\text{O} $  
4) Thermal decomposition of $ \text{CaCO}_3 $ is endothermic (heat is absorbed).
