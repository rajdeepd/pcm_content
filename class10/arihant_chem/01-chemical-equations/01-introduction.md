# 1.1–1.2 Introduction

## 1.1 Chemical Reactions

A chemical reaction is a change in which one or more substances (reactants) form new substances (products) with entirely different properties because old bonds break and new bonds form.

- Reactants are the starting substances; products are the new substances.  
- Example: A burning magnesium ribbon forms magnesium oxide (white powder) from magnesium and oxygen.

### Characteristics of Chemical Reactions
- Change in state  
- Change in colour  
- Evolution of a gas  
- Change in temperature  
- Formation of a precipitate

## 1.2 Chemical Equations

Chemical reactions can be represented as **word equations** or **chemical equations** (using symbols and formulae).

- Word equation example for methane combustion:  
  Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water
- Symbolic chemical equation:  
  $ \text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \longrightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $

### Writing a Chemical Equation
- Write reactants on the left with plus signs between them.  
- Write products on the right with plus signs between them.  
- Use an arrow (→) pointing toward products to show direction of reaction.  

For methane combustion (with heat):  
$ \text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $
