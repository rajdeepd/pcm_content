Those chemical substances which have a sour taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red are called acids. Some common fruits such as unripe mango, lemon, orange, tamarind etc., are sour in taste. This suggests that these fruits contain acids.

Some commonly used acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid $(H_2SO_4)$, nitric acid $(HNO_3)$ etc.

Some naturally occurring acids are as follows

| Natural source | Acid |
|---|---|
| Vinegar | Acetic acid |
| Orange and lemon | Citric acid |
| Tamarind | Tartaric acid |
| Tomato | Oxalic acid |
| Curd | Lactic acid |
| Ant's sting and nettle's sting | Methanoic acid |

## Chemical Properties of Acids

The significant chemical properties of acids are as follows

**• Reaction with metals** Acids like dilute HCl and dilute $H_2SO_4$, react with certain active metals like zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) etc., to form salt and evolves $H_2$ gas.

Thus, these acids or substances containing these kind of acids should not be kept in metal containers.

Metal + Dilute acid $\longrightarrow$ Salt + Hydrogen gas

e.g. $\text{Zn}(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) \longrightarrow \text{ZnSO}_4(aq) + H_2(g)$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Zinc} & \text{Dil. sulphuric} & \text{Zinc sulphate} & \text{Hydrogen} \\ \text{granules} & \text{acid} & & \text{gas} \end{matrix}$$

**Test for the presence of $H_2$ gas** It can be done by passing the gas through a soap solution and then, bringing a burning splinter near the soap bubble filled with the gas. If the gas burns with a pop sound, it confirms the presence of hydrogen gas.

**• Reaction with metal carbonates and metal hydrogen carbonates** Acids react with metal carbonates and metal hydrogen carbonates (also called bicarbonates) produces metal salts, water and evolve carbon dioxide gas with brisk effervescence.

Metal carbonate / Metal hydrogen carbonate + Acid  
$\longrightarrow$ Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water  
(Brisk effervescence)

e.g. $\text{CaCO}_3(s) + 2\text{HCl}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{CaCl}_2(aq) + H_2O(aq)$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Calcium} & \text{Hydrochloric} & \text{Calcium chloride} \\ \text{carbonate} & \text{acid} & \end{matrix}$$

$$+ \text{CO}_2(g) \uparrow$$

$$\text{Carbon dioxide}$$

Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate.

**Test for $CO_2$ gas** When $CO_2$ gas is passed through lime water, it turns milky due to the formation of white precipitate of $\text{CaCO}_3$.

$$\text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + H_2O(l)$$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{(Lime water)} & \text{Carbon} & \text{Calcium} & \text{Water} \\ & \text{dioxide} & \text{carbonate} & \\ & & \text{(White ppt.)} & \end{matrix}$$

But, if $CO_2$ is passed in excess, milkiness disappears due to the formation of $\text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2$ which is soluble in water.

$$\text{CaCO}_3(s) + H_2O(l) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2(aq)$$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Calcium} & \text{Water} & \text{Carbon} & \text{Calcium bicarbonate} \\ \text{carbonate} & & \text{dioxide} & \text{(Soluble in water)} \\ \text{(Milkiness)} & & \text{(Excess)} & \end{matrix}$$

**• Reaction with metallic oxides** Acids react with certain metallic oxides to form salt and water. Since, the chemical nature of these oxides are basic hence, they are also called basic oxides.

Metal oxide + Acid $\longrightarrow$ Salt + Water

e.g. $\text{CuO} + 2\text{HCl} \longrightarrow \text{CuCl}_2 + H_2O$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Copper (II)} & \text{Hydrochloric} & \text{Copper (II)} \\ \text{oxide} & \text{acid} & \text{chloride} \\ & & \text{(Blue green)} \end{matrix}$$
