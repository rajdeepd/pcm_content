# Case Based/Source Based Questions

**Direction (Q. Nos. 1-4)** Answer the questions on the basis of your understanding of the following passage and related studied concepts:

## 1. Sodium is a very important element

Many of its compounds are widely used by us, even in our food as well as for washing clothes. For example, washing soda is widely used for washing clothes. When it is saturated with carbon dioxide in moist environment, it gives a product called baking soda.

$$\text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2 \longrightarrow 2\text{NaHCO}_3$$

Baking soda is used in small amount in making bread and cake. It helps to make these soft and spongy. An aqueous solution of baking soda turns red litmus blue. It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.

<p class="question-text"><strong class="q-label">(i)</strong> Why is sodium hydrogen carbonate used in soda-acid fire extinguishers?</p>
<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> In soda-acid fire extinguishers, CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the reaction of sodium bicarbonate with an acid. The released CO<sub>2</sub> extinguishes the fire.</p>

<p class="question-text"><strong class="q-label">(ii)</strong> What is the approximate pH value of baking soda solution?</p>
<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> Baking soda (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) is a salt of strong base and weak acid, so its pH value must be greater than 7.</p>

<p class="question-text"><strong class="q-label">(iii)</strong> How many water of crystallisation are present in washing soda? What happens when we heat the crystals?</p>
<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> 10 water of crystallisation are present in washing soda. When we heat the compound, it loses its water of crystallisation (efflorescence occurs) and becomes anhydrous.</p>

<p class="question-text"><strong class="q-label">(iv)</strong> By which gas does baking powder help in making cakes and bread soft and spongy?</p>
<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> Baking powder is a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and a mild edible acid such as tartaric acid. When added to water or heated during baking, sodium hydrogen carbonate reacts with the acid and releases carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas. As the bubbles of CO<sub>2</sub> escape, they cause the cake to rise and it becomes soft and spongy.</p>

## 2. Salt pans in Marakkanam

The salt pans in Marakkanam, a port town about 120 km from Chennai are the third largest producer of salt in Tamil Nadu. Separation of salt from sea water is a laborious process and the salt obtained is used as raw materials for manufacture of various sodium compounds. One such compound is sodium hydrogen carbonate, used in baking, as an antacid and in soda acid fire extinguishers.

The table shows the mass of various compounds obtained when 1 L of sea water is evaporated.

| Compound           | Formula | Mass of solid present/g |
|--------------------|:-------:|:-----------------------:|
| Sodium chloride    |  NaCl   |          28.0           |
| Magnesium chloride |  MgCl<sub>2</sub>  |           8.0           |
| Magnesium sulphate |  MgSO<sub>4</sub>  |           6.0           |
| Calcium sulphate   |  CaSO<sub>4</sub>  |           2.0           |
| Calcium carbonate  |  CaCO<sub>3</sub>  |           1.0           |
| **Total amount of salt obtained** |   —    |          45.0           |

<p class="question-text"><strong class="q-label">(i)</strong> What is the pH of the acid which is used in the formation of common salt?</p>
<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> Common salt is formed from hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide base. The acid used is strong, so its pH value lies between 1 to 3.</p>
