<h4 style="text-transform: none;">1. Assertion (A): HCl produces hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and chloride ions (Cl⁻) in aqueous solution.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): In presence of water, basic solution give H⁺ ions.</h4>

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (c) Assertion is true but Reason is false.</p>

<p class="answer-text" style="margin-top: -10px;">HCl produces H⁺ ions in aqueous solution because in presence of water, acids give H⁺ ions. As H⁺ ions cannot exist alone so it combines with water molecules and form H₃O⁺.</p>

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">2. Assertion (A): Sodium hydroxide reacts with zinc to produce hydrogen gas.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): Acids react with active metals to produce hydrogen gas.</h4>

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (b) Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion. Sodium hydroxide being an strong base, reacts with active metal (zinc) to produce hydrogen gas. The reaction is:</p>

$$\text{Zn}(s) + 2\text{NaOH}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{ZnO}_2(aq) + \text{H}_2(g)$$

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">3. Assertion (A): It is advised that while diluting an acid one should add water to acid and not acid to water keeping the solution continuously stirred.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): The process of dissolving an acid into water is highly exothermic.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">4. Assertion (A): Phenolphthalein gives pink colour in basic solution.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): Phenolphthalein is a natural indicator.</h4>

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (c) Assertion is true but Reason is false. The correct form of Reason is: Phenolphthalein is a synthetic indicator.</p>

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">5. Assertion (A): If the pH inside the mouth decreases below 5.5, the decay of tooth enamel begins.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): The bacteria present in mouth degrades the sugar and left over food particles and produce acids that remains in the mouth after eating.</h4>

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (a) Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.</p>

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">6. Assertion (A): Fresh milk in which baking soda is added, takes a longer time to set as curd.</h4>

<h4 style="text-transform: none; margin-top: 0.5em;">Reason (R): Baking soda decreases the pH value of fresh milk to below 6.</h4>

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE SQP (Term-I)</span>

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (c) Assertion is true but Reason is false because baking soda, being a base, increase the pH value of fresh milk to above 6.</p>
