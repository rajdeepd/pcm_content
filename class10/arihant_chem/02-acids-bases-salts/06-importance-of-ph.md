Following are the examples showing importance of pH in everyday life.

## Plants and Animals are pH Sensitive

Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. Our body works normally within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.5. When pH of rain water goes below 5.6, it is called **acid rain**. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it lowers the pH of the river water and makes survival of aquatic life difficult.

## pH of the Soil

Every type of plant requires a specific pH range for their healthy growth. Therefore, the nature of soil is known first by testing its pH and then a particular crop is grown in it. It is also suitable for selecting the fertiliser for a particular crop by knowing the pH of the soil.

## pH in Our Digestive System

Our stomach produces hydrochloric acid (HCl), which helps in the digestion of food.

During indigestion, the stomach produces too much acid, which causes pain and irritation. To correct the disturbed pH range, magnesium hydroxide or milk of magnesia (a mild base) is used as a medicine, which is also called **antacid** as it neutralises the effect of acid (or acidity).

## pH Change Leads to Tooth Decay

Tooth enamel is made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium phosphate). It is the hardest substance in the body. If the pH inside the mouth decreases below 5.5 (acidic), the decay of tooth enamel begins.

The bacteria present in the mouth degrades the sugar and left over food particles that remains in the mouth after eating and produce acids. The best way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after eating food. To prevent tooth decay, toothpastes (basic) are used which neutralise the excess acid.

## Self Defence by Animals and Plants through Chemical Warfare

- When insects like honeybee, ant etc., bite, they inject an acid into the skin, that causes pain and irritation. If a mild base like baking soda is applied on the affected area, it gives relief.

- Stinging hair of nettle leaves (herbaceous plant which grows in wild) injects methanoic acid in the skin which causes burning pain. It is cured by rubbing the affected area with the leaves of dock plant, which often grows beside the nettle plant.
