Strength of an acid or base depends on the number of $H^+$ ions or $OH^-$ ions produced by them respectively. Larger the number of $H^+$ ions produced by an acid, stronger is the acid and *vice-versa*. Similarly, larger the number of $OH^-$ ions produced by a base, stronger is the base and *vice-versa*.

# 2.7 The pH Scale

It is a scale used for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. The **p** in pH stands for **potenz** which means **power** in German. It has values ranging from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). **pH is a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution.**

Higher the hydronium ion concentration present in the solution, lower is its pH value [pH means power of hydrogen ions].

- If pH > 7, solution is basic.
- If pH < 7, solution is acidic.
- If pH = 7, solution is neutral.

Pure water is neutral because of the absence of free ions. A paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH. Now-a-days, pH meter, an electronic device, is used to measure the pH value.
