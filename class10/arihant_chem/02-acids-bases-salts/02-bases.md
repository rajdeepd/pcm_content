Those chemical substances which are bitter in taste, soapy to touch and turn red litmus to blue are known as bases. e.g. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide $\text{Ca(OH)}_2$ etc.

## Chemical Properties of Bases

The significant chemical properties of bases are as follows

**• Reaction with metals** Strong bases react with active metals to produce hydrogen gas. Thus, these bases should not be kept in metal containers.

Metal + Base $\longrightarrow$ Salt + Hydrogen gas

e.g. $\text{Zn}(s) + 2\text{NaOH}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{ZnO}_2(s) + H_2(g)$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Zinc} & \text{Sodium} & \text{Sodium zincate} & \text{Hydrogen} \\ & \text{hydroxide} & & \text{gas} \end{matrix}$$

**• Reaction with non-metallic oxide** Bases react with non-metallic oxides to produce salt and water.

The chemical nature of non-metallic oxides are acidic in nature. Hence, they are called acidic oxides.

Base + Non-metallic oxide $\longrightarrow$ Salt + Water

e.g. $\text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + H_2O(l)$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Slaked lime} & \text{Carbon} & \text{Calcium} & \text{Water} \\ & \text{dioxide} & \text{carbonate} & \end{matrix}$$
