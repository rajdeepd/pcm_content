The substances that change their colour or odour when added into an acid or an alkaline solution to indicate the presence of an acid or a base are called **indicators**.

Indicators can be classified in the following ways

## On the Basis of Colour Change

These indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by change in colour.

### (I) Natural Indicators

These indicators are obtained from natural sources, e.g. litmus solution is a purple colour dye extracted from the lichen plant (belonging to the division "Thallophyta").

**Some Natural Indicators with Characteristic Colours**

| Indicator | Colour in Acidic Medium | Colour in Alkaline Medium |
|---|---|---|
| Litmus | Blue → Red | Red → Blue |
| Red cabbage juice (from leaves) | Red | Green |
| Turmeric (haldi) | Yellow | Reddish brown |
| Flower of *Hydrangea* plant | Blue | Pink |
| Flower of petunia | Reddish purple | Violet |
| Flower of geranium | Orange red | Blue |

### (II) Synthetic Indicators

The indicators which are synthesised in the laboratory or in industry and are not obtained by natural sources are known as synthetic indicators. e.g. Methyl orange, phenolphthalein etc.

**Some Synthetic Indicators with Characteristic Colours**

| Indicator | Colour in Acidic Solution | Colour in Basic Solution | Colour in Neutral Solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phenolphthalein | Colourless | Pink | Colourless |
| Methyl orange | Red | Yellow | Orange |

### (III) Universal Indicators

To predict *how* strong a given acid or base is, an universal indicator is preferred over litmus paper. It is a mixture of several indicators. It shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ion in a solution.

## On the Basis of Order Change

### Olfactory Indicators

Those substances whose odour changes in acidic or basic medium are called olfactory indicators. Vanilla extract, clove and onion can be used as olfactory indicators. The smell of vanilla and onion indicators can be detected in presence of an acid only but not in the presence of a base.
