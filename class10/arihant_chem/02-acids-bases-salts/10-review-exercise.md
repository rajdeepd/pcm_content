<h4 style="text-transform: none;">3. When sodium bicarbonate reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid the gas evolved is</h4>

<span class="badge-cbse">CBSE 2023</span>

(a) hydrogen; it given pop sound with burning match stick.  
(b) hydrogen; it turns lime water milky.  
(c) carbon dioxide; it turns lime water milky.  
(d) carbon dioxide it blows off a burning match stick with a pop sound.

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (c) When sodium bicarbonate reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid the gas evolved is carbon dioxide.</p>

$$
\text{NaHCO}_3(s) + 2\text{HCl}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq) + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{CO}_2(g)
$$

<p class="answer-text" style="margin-top: -10px;">When $\text{CO}_2$ is passed through lime water, it turns milky due to the formation of white precipitate of $\text{CaCO}_3$.</p>

---

<h4 style="text-transform: none;">4. Which of the following gives the correct increasing order of acid strength?</h4>

<span class="badge-ncert-exemplar">NCERT Exemplar</span>

(a) Water < acetic acid < hydrochloric acid  
(b) Water < hydrochloric acid < acetic acid  
(c) Acetic acid < water < hydrochloric acid  
(d) Hydrochloric acid < water < acetic acid

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (a) Hydrochloric acid ionises completely in water, that's why it is a strong acid. Acetic acid ionises only partially in water, hence, it is a weak acid. Water has some what neutral nature. Thus, the order of acidity is, water < acetic acid < hydrochloric acid.</p>

</div>

**The option that justifies the above stated observation that 'X' is aqueous calcium hydroxide and**

<span class="badge-competency">Competency Based Que.</span>

(a) it turns milky due to carbon dioxide gas liberated in the reaction and after sometime it becomes colourless due to formation of calcium carbonate.

(b) it turns milky due to formation of calcium carbonate and on passing excess of carbon dioxide it becomes colourless due to formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate which is soluble in water.

(c) it turns milky due to passing of carbon dioxide through it. It turns colourless as on further passing carbon dioxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate is formed which is soluble in water.

(d) the carbon dioxide liberated during the reaction turns lime water milky due to formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate and after some time it turns colourless due to formation of calcium carbonate which is soluble in water.

<p class="answer-text"><strong class="sol-label">Sol.</strong> (b) When \\(\text{CO}_2\\) gas is passed through lime water, it turns milky due to the formation of white precipitate of \\(\text{CaCO}_3\\).</p>

$$\text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)$$

<p class="answer-text" style="margin-top: -10px;">If excess of \\(\text{CO}_2\\) is passed, milkiness disappears due to the formation of \\(\text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2\\) which is soluble in water.</p>

$$\text{CaCO}_3(s) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{Ca(HCO}_3)_2(aq)$$
