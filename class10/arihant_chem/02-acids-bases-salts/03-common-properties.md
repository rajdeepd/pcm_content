**• In presence of water, all acids give $H^+$ ion.** These $[H^+]$ ion combines with water molecules and form $H_3O^+$ (hydronium ion). Hence, we can say that in presence of water, all acids give $H^+$ ion or $[H_3O^+]$ ion.

$$HA(aq) \longrightarrow H^+(aq) + A^-(aq)$$

$$\text{(Acid)}$$

e.g. $\text{HCl}(aq) \longrightarrow H^+(aq) + Cl^-(aq)$

$$H^+ + H_2O \longrightarrow H_3O^+$$

**• In presence of water, all the bases give $OH^-$ ion.**

$$BOH(aq) \longrightarrow B^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$$

$$\text{(Base)}$$

e.g. $\text{NaOH}(s) \xrightarrow{H_2O} Na^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$

$$\text{KOH}(s) \xrightarrow{H_2O} K^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$$

$$\text{Mg(OH)}_2(s) \longrightarrow Mg^{2+}(aq) + 2OH^-(aq)$$

**Note:** All bases do not dissolve in water except a few. The bases which can dissolve in water without undergoing any kind of chemical reactions are called alkalis. An alkali is a base which dissolves in water.

**• Since, ions help in conduction of charge, so aqueous solution of both acids and bases conducts electricity.** Therefore, the common property of acids and bases is to dissociate into ions in aqueous solution and conduct electricity.

## Effect of Dilution on an Acid or Base

Mixing of an acid or base with water is called **dilution**. It results in decrease in the concentration of ions $(H_3O^+/OH^-)$ per unit volume and the acid or base is said to be diluted.

When we dilute an acid or a base, the reaction is highly exothermic (heat generating). Hence, care must be taken while doing it. During dilution, *acids must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring*.

*Water should not be added to concentrated acid* because if water is added, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.

The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating.

## 2.4 Reaction between Acids and Bases

Acids react with bases to produce salt and water. In this reaction, an acid neutralises a base, i.e. acid nullifies or reduces the effect of a base or *vice-versa* thus, the reaction is known as **neutralisation reaction**.

In general, neutralisation reaction can be written as

Base + Acid $\longrightarrow$ Salt + Water

$$H(\overline{X + M})\text{ OH} \longrightarrow MX + \text{HOH}$$

Here, H represents hydrogen atom and $M$ represents metal atom.

$$H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq) \longrightarrow H_2O(l)$$

e.g. $\text{NaOH}(aq) + \text{HCl}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq) + H_2O(l)$

$$\begin{matrix} \text{Sodium} & \text{Hydrochloric} & \text{Sodium} & \text{Water} \\ \text{hydroxide} & \text{acid} & \text{chloride} & \end{matrix}$$

<li>Which acid is found in nettle's sting?</li>

</ol>

<h4>Solutions:</h4>

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Methanoic acid</strong> is found in nettle's sting.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Bases should not be kept in active metal containers because strong bases react with active metals to produce hydrogen gas. This can cause pressure build-up and potential hazards.</p>

$$\text{Zn}(s) + 2\text{NaOH}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{Na}_2\text{ZnO}_2(s) + H_2(g)$$

<p><strong>3.</strong> The precipitate formed when $CO_2$ reacts with lime water is <strong>calcium carbonate</strong> $(CaCO_3)$, which appears as a white precipitate.</p>

$$\text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + H_2O(l)$$

<p><strong>4.</strong> Non-metallic oxides are acidic in nature. This can be proved by the reaction of carbon dioxide (a non-metallic oxide) with calcium hydroxide (a base) to form salt and water:</p>

$$\text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) + \text{CO}_2(g) \longrightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + H_2O(l)$$

<p>This is an acid-base neutralization reaction, proving that $CO_2$ is acidic in nature.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> The effect of dilution on an acid or base is that it <strong>decreases the concentration of ions</strong> $(H_3O^+/OH^-)$ <strong>per unit volume</strong>. The acid or base becomes weaker. The reaction is highly exothermic (heat generating).</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> When sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid, the products formed are <strong>sodium chloride and water</strong>:</p>

$$\text{NaOH}(aq) + \text{HCl}(aq) \longrightarrow \text{NaCl}(aq) + H_2O(l)$$
