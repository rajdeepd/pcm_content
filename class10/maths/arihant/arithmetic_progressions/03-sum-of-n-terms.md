# TOPIC 03: Sum of First n Terms of an AP

## Formula for Sum of n Terms

The sum of first $n$ terms of an AP is given by:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$$

Where:
- $S_n$ = sum of first $n$ terms
- $n$ = number of terms
- $a$ = first term
- $d$ = common difference

## Alternative Formula (Using Last Term)

When the last term $l$ is known:

$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a + l)$$

Where:
- $a$ = first term
- $l$ = last term

## Sum of First n Positive Integers

$$1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
