# Arithmetic Progressions (AP)

In this chapter, we will study the sequence (list of numbers) in which succeeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We will find the formulae to find the value of any term and the sum of terms for this sequence.

## Sequence (List of Numbers)

A list of numbers arranged in a definite order according to some definite rule, is called a **sequence**.

**Examples:**

(i) $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots$

In this sequence each number is 1 more than the number preceding it, except first number.

(ii) $2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots$

In this sequence, each number is obtained on multiplying the preceding number by 2, except first number.

The various numbers occurring in a sequence are called its **terms**.

Consider, a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots$

Here, $a_1$ is called first term, $a_2$ is called second term and so on. Its $n$th term is denoted by $a_n$, which is also known as the **general term** of sequence.

A sequence is said to be **finite** or **infinite** accordingly if it has a finite or infinite number of terms.

---

## Progression

Those sequences whose terms always follow certain patterns are called **progressions**.

**Examples:**

(i) The sequence $3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots$ is a progression, as each term can be found by adding 2 to the term preceding it.

(ii) The sequence $3, 10, 18, 21, 35, \ldots$ is not a progression as its terms are not following any certain pattern.

> **Note:** All progressions are sequences but all sequences need not be progressions.

# TOPIC 01: Introduction to Arithmetic Progressions

## Arithmetic Progression (AP)

An **Arithmetic Progression (AP)** is a list of numbers in which each term is obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first term.

This fixed number is called the **common difference** ($d$) of the AP. It can be positive, negative or zero.

In other words, a list of numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n$ is called an arithmetic progression (AP), if there exists a constant number $d$ (called common difference) such that:

$$a_2 - a_1 = d$$
$$a_3 - a_2 = d$$
$$a_4 - a_3 = d$$
$$\vdots$$
$$a_n - a_{n-1} = d \text{ and so on.}$$

Each of the numbers in this list is called a **term**.

## General Form of an AP

In general, $a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, \ldots$ represent an arithmetic progression, where:
- $a$ is the **first term**
- $d$ is the **common difference**

This is called the **general form** of an AP.

## Finite and Infinite APs

- **Finite AP:** If number of terms in an AP is finite, then it is called a finite AP.
- **Infinite AP:** If number of terms is infinite, then it is called an infinite AP. Such APs do not have a last term.

> **Note:** If the common difference of an AP is zero i.e. $d = 0$, then each term of the AP will be same as the first term of the AP.

## Solved Examples

### Example 1: Find the common difference of the following APs.

*[CBSE 2019]*

(i) $3, -2, -7, -12, \ldots$

(ii) $11, 11, 11, 11, \ldots$

(iii) $5\frac{1}{2}, 9\frac{1}{2}, 13\frac{1}{2}, 17\frac{1}{2}, \ldots$

(iv) $\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{12}, \sqrt{27}, \sqrt{48}, \ldots$

**Solution:**

**(i)** Given AP is $3, -2, -7, -12, \ldots$

Here, $a_1 = 3$, $a_2 = -2$, $a_3 = -7$, $a_4 = -12$

∴ Common difference $(d) = a_2 - a_1 = -2 - 3 = -5$

**(ii)** Given AP is $11, 11, 11, 11, \ldots$

Here, $a_1 = 11$, $a_2 = 11$, $a_3 = 11$, $a_4 = 11$

∴ Common difference $(d) = a_2 - a_1 = 11 - 11 = 0$

**(iii)** Given AP is $5\frac{1}{2}, 9\frac{1}{2}, 13\frac{1}{2}, 17\frac{1}{2}, \ldots$

Here, $a_1 = 5\frac{1}{2}$, $a_2 = 9\frac{1}{2}$, $a_3 = 13\frac{1}{2}$, $a_4 = 17\frac{1}{2}$

∴ Common difference $(d) = a_2 - a_1 = 9\frac{1}{2} - 5\frac{1}{2} = \frac{19}{2} - \frac{11}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$

**(iv)** Given AP is $\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{12}, \sqrt{27}, \sqrt{48}, \ldots$

Here, $a_1 = \sqrt{3}$, $a_2 = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}$, $a_3 = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3}$, $a_4 = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}$

∴ Common difference $(d) = a_2 - a_1 = 2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}$

## Method to Check an AP When a List of Numbers is Given

Sometimes, a list of numbers or sequence is given and we have to check that this sequence is an AP or not. For this, we find the differences of consecutive terms. If these differences are same, then given list of numbers or sequence is an AP, otherwise not.

### Example 2: Examine that the list of numbers $13, 10, 7, 4, \ldots$ form an AP. If it forms an AP, then write the next two terms.

**Solution:**

Here, we have:
- $a_2 - a_1 = 10 - 13 = -3$
- $a_3 - a_2 = 7 - 10 = -3$
- $a_4 - a_3 = 4 - 7 = -3$

Since, difference of any two consecutive terms is same, so the given list of numbers form an AP.

Now, the next two terms are:
- $4 + (-3) = 1$
- $1 + (-3) = -2$

∴ Next two terms are **1** and **-2**.

### Example 3: Real-World Application

**Problem:** Examine that the list of numbers obtained from following situation, will be in the form of an AP.

"Amount left with Sandeep (in ₹) out of the total amount of ₹12000 which he had in the beginning, when he spends ₹500 in the beginning of every month."

**Solution:**

Given, in the beginning Sandeep had = ₹12000

Also, in the beginning of every month, he spent = ₹500

So, the amounts at the beginning of each month form the sequence:

| Month | Amount (₹) |
|-------|------------|
| 1st | 12000 |
| 2nd | 12000 - 500 = 11500 |
| 3rd | 11500 - 500 = 11000 |
| 4th | 11000 - 500 = 10500 |

The sequence is: $12000, 11500, 11000, 10500, \ldots$

Common difference: $d = 11500 - 12000 = -500$

Since the difference is constant, **Yes, this forms an AP** with:
- First term $a = 12000$
- Common difference $d = -500$

---

## Method to Write an AP When First Term and Common Difference are Given

To write an AP, the minimum information required is to know the first term $a$ and the common difference $d$ of the arithmetic progression. Then, we put the values of $a$ and $d$ in $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots$ to get the required AP.

### Example 4: Write an AP having 4 as the first term and -3 as the common difference.

**Solution:**

Given, first term $(a) = 4$ and common difference $(d) = -3$

On putting the values of $a$ and $d$ in general form $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots$, we get:

$$4, 4-3, 4+2(-3), 4+3(-3), \ldots$$

$$4, 1, 4-6, 4-9, \ldots$$

$$4, 1, -2, -5, \ldots$$

which is the required AP.

### Answers - Try These 5.1

| Q | Answer |
|---|--------|
| 1(i) | No |
| 1(ii) | Yes |
| 1(iii) | No |
| 1(iv) | Yes |
| 2 | $\sqrt{3}$ |
| 3(i) | $a = 5$, $d = 3$ |
| 3(ii) | $a = \frac{1}{4}$, $d = 1$ |
| 4(i) | $d = 6$; Next two terms: 24, 30 |
| 4(ii) | $d = 8$; Next two terms: 37, 45 |
| 5(i) | $-2, -4, -6, -8$ |
| 5(ii) | $-1, 3, 7, 11$ |
| 6 | Yes; 31, 37 |
| 9(i) | No |
| 9(ii) | Yes |

**7(i) Solution:**

$a_1 = 4$, $a_2 = 8$, $a_3 = 12$

$a_2 - a_1 = 8 - 4 = 4$ and $a_3 - a_2 = 12 - 8 = 4$

Since $a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2$, the given list forms an AP with $a = 4$, $d = 4$

Next three terms:
- $a_5 = a + 4d = 4 + 4 \times 4 = 20$
- $a_6 = a + 5d = 4 + 5 \times 4 = 24$
- $a_7 = a + 6d = 4 + 6 \times 4 = 28$

**7(ii) Solution:**

$a_1 = 1^2 = 1$, $a_2 = 2^2 = 4$, $a_3 = 3^2 = 9$

$a_2 - a_1 = 4 - 1 = 3$ and $a_3 - a_2 = 9 - 4 = 5$

Since $a_2 - a_1 \neq a_3 - a_2$, the given list **does not form an AP**.

**8 Solution:**

Next three terms: $(a+2)+(b+1)$, $(a+2)+(b+2)$, $(a+3)+(b+2)$
