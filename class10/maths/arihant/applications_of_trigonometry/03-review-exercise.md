### MCQ Answers

<a id="a1"></a>**1.** (b) $45°$ [← Question](#q1)

Let height of tower = $h$, then shadow = $h$
$\tan \theta = \frac{h}{h} = 1 = \tan 45°$
$\therefore \theta = 45°$

<a id="a2"></a>**2.** (a) $60°$ [← Question](#q2)

$\tan \theta = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3} = \tan 60°$
$\therefore \theta = 60°$

<a id="a3"></a>**3.** (c) 15 m [← Question](#q3)

$\sin 30° = \frac{h}{30}$
$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{h}{30}$
$h = 15$ m

<a id="a4"></a>**4.** (a) 75 m [← Question](#q4)

Given: $\tan \theta = \frac{15}{8}$, so $\sin \theta = \frac{15}{17}$, $\cos \theta = \frac{8}{17}$
Height $= 85 \times \sin \theta = 85 \times \frac{15}{17} = 75$ m

<a id="a5"></a>**5.** (a) 12 m [← Question](#q5)

Height difference = $20 - 14 = 6$ m
$\sin 30° = \frac{6}{\text{wire length}}$
$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{\text{wire}}$
Wire length $= 12$ m

<a id="a6"></a>**6.** (b) $45°$ [← Question](#q6)

Effective height = $22 - 1.5 = 20.5$ m
$\tan \theta = \frac{20.5}{20.5} = 1 = \tan 45°$
$\therefore \theta = 45°$

<a id="a7"></a>**7.** (a) 75 m [← Question](#q7)

$\frac{\text{Tree height}}{\text{Tree shadow}} = \frac{\text{Pole height}}{\text{Pole shadow}}$
$\frac{6}{4} = \frac{h}{50}$
$h = \frac{6 \times 50}{4} = 75$ m

<a id="a8"></a>**8.** (b) 92.37 m [← Question](#q8)

$\sin 60° = \frac{80}{\text{string}}$
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{80}{\text{string}}$
String $= \frac{160}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{160\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 92.37$ m

<a id="a9"></a>**9.** (b) $30\sqrt{3}$ [← Question](#q9)

$\tan 60° = \frac{h}{30}$
$\sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{30}$
$h = 30\sqrt{3}$ m

<a id="a10"></a>**10.** (c) 21.856 m [← Question](#q10)

From angle of depression $45°$: Distance $= 8$ m
From angle of elevation $60°$: Extra height $= 8\sqrt{3} = 13.856$ m
Total height $= 8 + 13.856 = 21.856$ m

<a id="a11"></a>**11.** (c) $80\sqrt{2}$ m [← Question](#q11)

$\sin 45° = \frac{80}{\text{distance}}$
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{80}{\text{distance}}$
Distance $= 80\sqrt{2}$ m

<a id="a12"></a>**12.** (a) 3 m [← Question](#q12)

Let pole break at height $h$, then fallen part $= 9 - h$
$\sin 30° = \frac{h}{9-h}$
$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{h}{9-h}$
$9 - h = 2h \Rightarrow h = 3$ m

<a id="a13"></a>**13.** (c) 13.5 m [← Question](#q13)

(Answer based on figure - need figure to verify calculation)

<a id="a14"></a>**14.** [← Question](#q14)

**(i)** (b) $45°$
$\tan \theta = \frac{42}{42} = 1 = \tan 45°$
$\therefore \theta = 45°$

**(ii)** (d) 24.64 m
$\tan 60° = \frac{42}{d}$
$\sqrt{3} = \frac{42}{d}$
$d = \frac{42}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{42\sqrt{3}}{3} = 14\sqrt{3} \approx 24.25$ m

**(iii)** (a) $20\sqrt{3}$ m
$\tan 60° = \frac{h}{20}$
$\sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{20}$
$h = 20\sqrt{3}$ m

**(iv)** (b) $45°$
Ratio $= 1:1$ means $\tan \theta = 1 = \tan 45°$
$\therefore \theta = 45°$

**(v)** (c) angle of depression

<a id="a15"></a>**15.** [← Question](#q15)

**(i)** In $\triangle OPB$: $\cos 30° = \frac{36}{\text{wire}}$
$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{36}{\text{wire}}$
Wire length $= \frac{72}{\sqrt{3}} = 24\sqrt{3}$ m

**(ii)** Height of $B$ from base: $\tan 30° = \frac{PB}{36}$
$PB = \frac{36}{\sqrt{3}} = 12\sqrt{3}$ m

Height of $A$ from base: $\tan 45° = \frac{PA}{36}$
$PA = 36$ m

$AB = PA - PB = 36 - 12\sqrt{3} = 36 - 20.78 = 15.22$ m

**(iii)** Height of Section $A$ from base $= 36$ m

**Or** Area of $\triangle OPB = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 \times 12\sqrt{3} = 216\sqrt{3}$ m²

---

<a id="a16"></a>**16.** [← Question](#q16)

**(i)** At what distance from the foot of the tree was he observing the bird?
$\tan 45° = \frac{80}{d}$
$1 = \frac{80}{d}$
$d = 80$ m

**(ii)** How far did the bird fly?
Initial position: 80 m from Kaushik (at tree)
After 2s at $30°$: $\tan 30° = \frac{80}{d_2}$
$d_2 = 80\sqrt{3}$ m
Distance flown by bird $= 80\sqrt{3} - 80 = 80(\sqrt{3} - 1) \approx 58.56$ m

**Or** How far did the ball travel?
Ball position at $60°$: $\tan 60° = \frac{80}{d_3}$
$d_3 = \frac{80}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{80\sqrt{3}}{3}$ m
Distance traveled by ball from tree $= 80 - \frac{80\sqrt{3}}{3} = 80\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\right) \approx 33.87$ m

**(iii)** Speed of bird if it flew $20(\sqrt{3}+1)$ m in 2 s:
Speed $= \frac{20(\sqrt{3}+1)}{2}$ m/s $= 10(\sqrt{3}+1)$ m/s
In m/min: $= 10(\sqrt{3}+1) \times 60 = 600(\sqrt{3}+1) \approx 1639.2$ m/min
