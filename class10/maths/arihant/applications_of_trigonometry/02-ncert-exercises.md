## Exercise 9.1

### Q1
A circus artist is climbing a 20 m long rope, which is tightly stretched and tied from the top of a vertical pole to the ground. Find the height of the pole, if the angle made by the rope with ground level is $30°$.

<img src="images/ncert-fig1.png" alt="Q1 Figure" width="30%">

**Solution:**
In the given figure, $AB$ is the height of the pole and $AC = 20$ m is the length of rope.

In right angled $\triangle ABC$,
$\sin 30° = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AB}{20}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} = \frac{AB}{20}$
$\therefore AB = 10$ m

Hence, the height of the pole is **10 m**.

### Q3
A contractor plans to install two slides for the children to play in a park. For the children below the age of 5 years, she prefers to have a slide whose top is at a height of 1.5 m and is inclined at an angle of $30°$ to the ground, whereas for elder children, she wants to have a steep slide at a height of 3 m and inclined at an angle of $60°$ to the ground. What should be the length of the slide in each case?

<img src="images/ncert-fig3.png" alt="Q3 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**

**Case I:** Slide for children below age 5 years.
Let $BC = 1.5$ m be the height and $AC$ be the slide inclined at $30°$.

In right angled $\triangle ABC$,
$\sin 30° = \frac{BC}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1.5}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow AC = 3$ m

**Case II:** Slide for elder children.
Let $RQ = 3$ m be the height and $PR$ be the slide inclined at $60°$.

In right angled $\triangle PQR$,
$\sin 60° = \frac{RQ}{PR}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{PR}$
$\Rightarrow PR = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}$ m [by rationalising]

Hence, the length of slides are **3 m** and **$2\sqrt{3}$ m**.

### Q4
The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from a point on the ground, which is 30 m away from the foot of the tower is $30°$. Find the height of the tower.

<img src="images/ncert-fig4.png" alt="Q4 Figure" width="30%">

**Solution:**
Let $BC$ be the height of the tower and $A$ be the point 30 m away from foot.
Then, $AB = 30$ m and $\angle BAC = 30°$

In right angled $\triangle ABC$,
$\tan 30° = \frac{BC}{AB}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{BC}{30}$
$\Rightarrow BC = \frac{30}{\sqrt{3}} = 10\sqrt{3}$ m [by rationalising]

Hence, the height of the tower is **$10\sqrt{3}$ m**.

---

### Q5
A kite is flying at a height of 60 m above the ground. The string attached to the kite is temporarily tied to a point on the ground. The inclination of the string with the ground is $60°$. Find the length of the string, assuming that there is no slack in the string.

<img src="images/ncert-fig5.png" alt="Q5 Figure" width="30%">

**Solution:**
Let $C$ be the position of kite, $AC$ be the string at $60°$, and $BC = 60$ m.

In right angled $\triangle ABC$,
$\sin 60° = \frac{BC}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{60}{AC}$
$\therefore AC = \frac{120}{\sqrt{3}} = 40\sqrt{3}$ m [by rationalising]

Hence, the length of the string is **$40\sqrt{3}$ m**.

---

### Q6
A 1.5 m tall boy is standing at some distance from a 30 m tall building. The angle of elevation from his eyes to the top of the building increases from $30°$ to $60°$ as he walks towards the building. Find the distance he walked towards the building.

<img src="images/ncert-fig6.png" alt="Q6 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**
Let $AB = 30$ m be the building height and $DC = 1.5$ m be the boy's height.
Draw $DF \parallel CA$. Then $CD = AF = 1.5$ m
$\angle BDF = 30°$ (initial), $\angle BEF = 60°$ (final)
Let $DE = x$ m (distance walked), $EF = y$ m
$BF = AB - AF = 30 - 1.5 = 28.5$ m

In $\triangle BFD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{BF}{DF} = \frac{28.5}{x + y}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{28.5}{x + y}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle BFE$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{BF}{EF}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{28.5}{y}$
$\Rightarrow y = \frac{28.5}{\sqrt{3}}$ m

Substituting in (i):
$x + \frac{28.5}{\sqrt{3}} = 28.5\sqrt{3}$
$\Rightarrow x = 28.5\left(\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = 28.5 \times \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{57\sqrt{3}}{3} = 19\sqrt{3}$ m

Hence, the distance he walked is **$19\sqrt{3}$ m**.

### Q7
From a point on the ground, the angles of elevation of the bottom and the top of a transmission tower fixed at the top of a 20 m high building are $45°$ and $60°$ respectively. Find the height of the tower. *[CBSE 2024, 2020 Standard]*

<img src="images/ncert-fig7.png" alt="Q7 Figure" width="35%">

**Solution:** Do same as Example 7.

**Answer:** 14.64 m

### Q8
A statue, 1.6 m tall, stands on the top of a pedestal. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation of the top of the statue is $60°$ and from the same point, the angle of elevation of the top of the pedestal is $45°$. Find the height of the pedestal.

<img src="images/ncert-fig8.png" alt="Q8 Figure" width="35%">

**Solution:**
Let $BC = h$ m be the pedestal height and $CD = 1.6$ m be the statue.
$\angle DAB = 60°$ and $\angle CAB = 45°$. Let $AB = x$ m.

In $\triangle ABD$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{BD}{AB}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{h + 1.6}{x}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle ABC$:
$\tan 45° = \frac{BC}{AB}$
$\Rightarrow 1 = \frac{h}{x}$
$\Rightarrow x = h$ ... (ii)

Substituting (ii) in (i):
$\sqrt{3}h = h + 1.6$
$\Rightarrow h(\sqrt{3} - 1) = 1.6$
$\Rightarrow h = \frac{1.6}{\sqrt{3} - 1} \times \frac{\sqrt{3} + 1}{\sqrt{3} + 1} = \frac{1.6(\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 0.8(\sqrt{3} + 1)$ m

Hence, the height of the pedestal is **$0.8(\sqrt{3} + 1)$ m**.

### Q9
The angle of elevation of the top of a building from the foot of the tower is $30°$ and the angle of elevation of the top of the tower from the foot of the building is $60°$. If the tower is 50 m high, find the height of the building.

<img src="images/ncert-fig9.png" alt="Q9 Figure" width="35%">

**Solution:**
Let $BC = 50$ m (tower) and $AD = h$ m (building).
$\angle DBA = 30°$ and $\angle CAB = 60°$. Let $AB = x$ m.

In $\triangle BAD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{AD}{AB}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{x}$
$\Rightarrow h = \frac{x}{\sqrt{3}}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle CBA$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{BC}{AB}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{50}{x}$
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{50}{\sqrt{3}}$ m

Substituting in (i):
$h = \frac{50}{\sqrt{3}} \times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{50}{3} = 16\frac{2}{3}$ m

Hence, the height of the building is **$16\frac{2}{3}$ m**.

### Q10
Two poles of equal heights are standing opposite to each other on either side of the road, which is 80 m wide. From a point between them on the road, the angles of elevation of the top of the poles are $60°$ and $30°$, respectively. Find the height of the poles and the distances of the point from the poles. *[CBSE 2015, 2019, Sample Paper 2020 Standard]*

<img src="images/ncert-fig10.png" alt="Q10 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**
Let $AB = 80$ m (road width), poles $AE = BD = h$ m.
Point $C$ on road: $\angle BCD = 60°$ and $\angle ACE = 30°$
Let $BC = x$ m, then $AC = (80 - x)$ m

In $\triangle CAE$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{AE}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{80 - x}$
$\Rightarrow h\sqrt{3} + x = 80$ ... (i)

In $\triangle CBD$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{BD}{BC}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{x}$
$\Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x$ ... (ii)

Substituting (ii) in (i):
$\sqrt{3}x \cdot \sqrt{3} + x = 80$
$\Rightarrow 4x = 80$
$\Rightarrow x = 20$ m

From (ii): $h = 20\sqrt{3}$ m
$AC = 80 - 20 = 60$ m

Hence, height of poles = **$20\sqrt{3}$ m**, distances from poles = **20 m** and **60 m**.

### Q11
A TV tower stands vertically on a bank of a canal. From a point on the other bank directly opposite the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $60°$. From another point 20 m away from this point on the line joining this point to the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the tower is $30°$. Find the height of the tower and the width of the canal.

<img src="images/ncert-fig11.png" alt="Q11 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**
Let $BC = x$ m (canal width) and $AB = h$ m (tower height).
$\angle ACB = 60°$ and $\angle ADB = 30°$

In $\triangle ABD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{AB}{DB}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{20 + x}$
$\Rightarrow 20 + x = h\sqrt{3}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle ABC$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{AB}{BC}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{x}$
$\Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x$ ... (ii)

Substituting (ii) in (i):
$20 + x = \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3}x) = 3x$
$\Rightarrow 2x = 20$
$\Rightarrow x = 10$ m

From (ii): $h = 10\sqrt{3}$ m

Hence, height of tower = **$10\sqrt{3}$ m**, width of canal = **10 m**.

### Q12
From the top of a 7 m high building, the angle of elevation of the top of a cable tower is $60°$ and the angle of depression of its foot is $45°$. Determine the height of the tower. *[CBSE 2020 Standard]*

<img src="images/ncert-fig12.png" alt="Q12 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:** Do same as Example 6.

**Answer:** $7(\sqrt{3} + 1)$ m or approximately **19.12 m**.

### Q13
As observed from the top of a 75 m high lighthouse from the sea level, the angles of depression of two ships are $30°$ and $45°$. If one ship is exactly behind the other on the same side of the lighthouse, then find the distance between the two ships.

<img src="images/ncert-fig13.png" alt="Q13 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**
Let $CD = 75$ m (lighthouse). Ships at $A$ and $B$.
$\angle ODA = 30°$ and $\angle ODB = 45°$
$\Rightarrow \angle CAD = 30°$ and $\angle CBD = 45°$ (alternate angles)
Let $AB = y$ m and $BC = x$ m.

In $\triangle ACD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{CD}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{75}{x + y}$
$\Rightarrow x + y = 75\sqrt{3}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle BCD$:
$\tan 45° = \frac{CD}{BC}$
$\Rightarrow 1 = \frac{75}{x}$
$\Rightarrow x = 75$ m

From (i): $y = 75\sqrt{3} - 75 = 75(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ m

Hence, distance between ships = **$75(\sqrt{3} - 1)$ m**.

### Q14
A 1.2 m tall girl spots a balloon moving with the wind in a horizontal line at a height of 88.2 m from the ground. The angle of elevation of the balloon from the eyes of the girl at any instant is $60°$. After sometime, the angle of elevation reduces to $30°$. Find the distance travelled by the balloon during the interval. *[CBSE 2009, Sample Paper 2020 Basic]*

<img src="images/ncert-fig14.png" alt="Q14 Figure" width="45%">

**Solution:**
Girl height $AD = 1.2$ m, balloon height = 88.2 m
$FG = EC = 88.2 - 1.2 = 87$ m
$\angle FDG = 60°$ and $\angle EDC = 30°$
Let $DG = x$ m, $GC = y$ m (distance travelled).

In $\triangle FGD$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{FG}{DG}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{87}{x}$
$\Rightarrow x = \frac{87}{\sqrt{3}}$ ... (i)

In $\triangle ECD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{EC}{DC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{87}{x + y}$
$\Rightarrow x + y = 87\sqrt{3}$ ... (ii)

Substituting (i) in (ii):
$y = 87\sqrt{3} - \frac{87}{\sqrt{3}} = 87\left(\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = \frac{87 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} = 58\sqrt{3}$ m

Hence, distance travelled by balloon = **$58\sqrt{3}$ m**.

### Q15
A straight highway leads to the foot of a tower. A man standing at the top of the tower observes a car at an angle of depression of $30°$, which is approaching the foot of the tower with a uniform speed. Six seconds later, the angle of depression of the car is found to be $60°$. Find the time taken by the car to reach the foot of the tower from this point.

<img src="images/ncert-fig15.png" alt="Q15 Figure" width="40%">

**Solution:**
Let $CD = h$ m (tower). Car moves from $A$ to $B$ in 6 seconds.
$\angle ODA = 30°$ and $\angle ODB = 60°$
$\Rightarrow \angle DAC = 30°$ and $\angle DBC = 60°$ (alternate angles)
Let $AB = y$ m, $BC = x$ m, speed = $k$ m/s.

In $\triangle BCD$:
$\tan 60° = \frac{CD}{BC}$
$\Rightarrow \sqrt{3} = \frac{h}{x}$
$\Rightarrow h = \sqrt{3}x$ ... (i)

In $\triangle ACD$:
$\tan 30° = \frac{CD}{AC}$
$\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{x + y}$
$\Rightarrow x + y = h\sqrt{3} = 3x$ [from (i)]
$\Rightarrow y = 2x$ ... (ii)

Since car travels $y$ m in 6 seconds:
$6 = \frac{y}{k}$
$\Rightarrow y = 6k$

From (ii): $6k = 2x \Rightarrow x = 3k$

Time to travel from $B$ to $C$ = $\frac{x}{k} = \frac{3k}{k} = 3$ s

Hence, time taken = **3 seconds**.
