## 5.3 nth Term of an AP

Let us consider the situation again, given in Section 5.1 in which Reena applied for a job and got selected. She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of ₹ 8000, with an annual increment of ₹ 500. What would be her monthly salary for the fifth year?

To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year would be. It would be ₹ (8000 + 500) = ₹ 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly salary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ₹ 500 to the salary of the previous year.

So, the salary for the 3rd year = ₹ (8500 + 500) = ₹ (8000 + 2 × 500) = ₹ [8000 + (3 – 1) × 500] = ₹ 9000  

Salary for the 4th year = ₹ (9000 + 500) = ₹ (8000 + 3 × 500) = ₹ [8000 + (4 – 1) × 500] = ₹ 9500  

Salary for the 5th year = ₹ (9500 + 500) = ₹ (8000 + 4 × 500) = ₹ [8000 + (5 – 1) × 500] = ₹ 10000  

Observe that we are getting a list of numbers  
8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, . . .  
These numbers are in AP. (Why?)

Now, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for the 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job, what about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding ₹ 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make this process shorter? Let us see.

Salary for the 15th year = Salary for the 14th year + ₹ 500 = ₹ [8000 + 14 × 500] = ₹ [8000 + (15 – 1) × 500] = ₹ 15000  
i.e., First salary + (15 – 1) × Annual increment.

In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be  
₹ [8000 + (25 – 1) × 500] = ₹ 20000 = First salary + (25 – 1) × Annual increment.

This example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term, or the 25th term, and more generally, the $n$th term of the AP.

Let $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, . . . be an AP whose first term $a_1$ is $a$ and the common difference is $d$. Then,

- the second term $a_2 = a + d = a + (2 – 1)d$
- the third term $a_3 = a_2 + d = (a + d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1)d$
- the fourth term $a_4 = a_3 + d = (a + 2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4 – 1)d$
- ………

Looking at the pattern, we can say that the $n$th term $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$.

So, the **$n$th term** $a_n$ of the AP with first term $a$ and common difference $d$ is given by  
$$a_n = a + (n – 1)d.$$

$a_n$ is also called the **general term** of the AP. If there are $m$ terms in the AP, then $a_m$ represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by $l$.

Let us consider some examples.

<div class="example" markdown="1">

### Example 3

Find the 10th term of the AP : 2, 7, 12, . . .

**Solution :** Here, $a = 2$, $d = 7 – 2 = 5$ and $n = 10$.  
We have $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$.  
So, $a_{10} = 2 + (10 – 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47$.  
Therefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47.

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">

### Example 4

Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give reason for your answer.

**Solution :** Here, $a = 21$, $d = 18 – 21 = –3$ and $a_n = –81$, and we have to find $n$.  
As $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$, we have –81 = 21 + $(n – 1)(–3)$ ⇒ –81 = 24 – 3n ⇒ –105 = –3n ⇒ $n = 35$.  
Therefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81.

Next, we want to know if there is any $n$ for which $a_n = 0$. If such an $n$ is there, then 21 + $(n – 1)(–3) = 0$, i.e., 3$(n – 1)$ = 21, i.e., $n = 8$. So, the eighth term is 0.

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">

### Example 5

Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9.

**Solution :** We have $a_3 = a + (3 – 1)d = a + 2d = 5$ … (1) and $a_7 = a + (7 – 1)d = a + 6d = 9$ … (2).  
Solving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get $a = 3$, $d = 1$.  
Hence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . .

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">

### Example 6

Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . .

**Solution :** We have $a_2 – a_1 = 11 – 5 = 6$, $a_3 – a_2 = 17 – 11 = 6$, $a_4 – a_3 = 23 – 17 = 6$. As $a_{k+1} – a_k$ is the same for $k = 1, 2, 3$, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP. Now, $a = 5$ and $d = 6$. Let 301 be the $n$th term of this AP. Then $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$ ⇒ 301 = 5 + $(n – 1) × 6$ ⇒ 301 = 6n – 1 ⇒ $n = \frac{302}{6} = \frac{151}{3}$. But $n$ should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of numbers.

### Example 7

How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3?

**Solution :** The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is : 12, 15, 18, . . ., 99. This is an AP. Here $a = 12$, $d = 3$, $a_n = 99$. As $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$, we have 99 = 12 + $(n – 1) × 3$ ⇒ 87 = $(n – 1) × 3$ ⇒ $n – 1 = 29$ ⇒ $n = 30$. So, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3.

</div>

<div class="example" markdown="1">

### Example 8

Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the AP : 10, 7, 4, . . ., – 62.

**Solution :** Here $a = 10$, $d = 7 – 10 = –3$, $l = –62$, where $l = a + (n – 1)d$. To find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in the AP. So –62 = 10 + $(n – 1)(–3)$ ⇒ –72 = $(n – 1)(–3)$ ⇒ $n – 1 = 24$ ⇒ $n = 25$. So, there are 25 terms. The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. So $a_{15} = 10 + (15 – 1)(–3) = 10 – 42 = –32$. So, the 11th term from the last term is – 32.

**Alternative Solution :** If we write the given AP in the reverse order, then $a = –62$ and $d = 3$ (Why?). So, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these $a$ and $d$. So $a_{11} = –62 + (11 – 1) × 3 = –62 + 30 = –32$. So, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is – 32.

### Example 9

A sum of ₹ 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the interest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest at the end of 30 years making use of this fact.

**Solution :** We know that Simple Interest = $\frac{P × R × T}{100}$. So, the interest at the end of the 1st year = ₹ $\frac{1000 × 8 × 1}{100}$ = ₹ 80; 2nd year = ₹ 160; 3rd year = ₹ 240; and so on. So, the interest (in ₹) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are 80, 160, 240, . . . It is an AP with $d = 80$, $a = 80$. So $a_{30} = a + (30 – 1)d = 80 + 29 × 80 = 2400$. So, the interest at the end of 30 years will be ₹ 2400.

### Example 10

In a flower bed, there are 23 rose plants in the first row, 21 in the second, 19 in the third, and so on. There are 5 rose plants in the last row. How many rows are there in the flower bed?

**Solution :** The number of rose plants in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., rows are : 23, 21, 19, . . ., 5. It forms an AP (Why?). Let the number of rows be $n$. Then $a = 23$, $d = 21 – 23 = –2$, $a_n = 5$. As $a_n = a + (n – 1)d$, we have 5 = 23 + $(n – 1)(–2)$ ⇒ –18 = $(n – 1)(–2)$ ⇒ $n = 10$. So, there are 10 rows in the flower bed.
