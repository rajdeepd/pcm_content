| 30 | Proof | **Step 1:** Assume $\sqrt{3}$ is rational, so $\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q}$ where p, q are coprime integers (HCF = 1) <br> **Step 2:** Squaring: $3 = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$ → $3q^2 = p^2$ <br> **Step 3:** Since $p^2$ is divisible by 3, p must be divisible by 3. Let $p = 3m$ <br> **Step 4:** Then $3q^2 = 9m^2$ → $q^2 = 3m^2$ → q is also divisible by 3 <br> **Step 5:** Both p and q divisible by 3 contradicts HCF(p,q) = 1 <br> ∴ $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational |
| 31 | ₹3,780 | Interest each year = $\frac{2000 \times 7}{100} = ₹140$ <br> AP: 140, 280, 420... with $d = 140$ <br> $a_{27} = 140 + 26(140) = ₹3780$ |

| 32b | H = $4(3+\sqrt{3})$ m, d = $4(3+\sqrt{3})$ m | Let H = height, d = distance. $\tan 45° = \frac{H}{d}$ → $d = H$ <br> $\tan 30° = \frac{H-8}{d}$ → $d = (H-8)\sqrt{3}$ <br> $H = (H-8)\sqrt{3}$ → $H = 4(3+\sqrt{3}) ≈ 18.93$ m |
| 33a | 6 cm, 4 cm | Let sides = a, b. $a^2 + b^2 = 52$, $4a - 4b = 8$ → $a = b + 2$ <br> $(b+2)^2 + b^2 = 52$ → $b^2 + 2b - 24 = 0$ → $b = 4$, $a = 6$ |
