## <span class="sub-header">Electric Charge</span>

A charge is a physical entity which is defined by excess or deficiency of electrons on a body.

It is denoted by $q$.

The SI unit of electric charge is <b>coulomb (C)</b>, which is equivalent to the charge contained in nearly $6 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

A body is said to be <b>negatively charged</b>, if it gains electrons. e.g. An ebonite rod rubbed with fur acquires negative charge. A body is said to be <b>positively charged</b>, if it loses electrons. e.g. A glass rod rubbed with a silk cloth acquires positive charge.

<b>Important Facts about Electric Charge</b>
<ul>
<li>Magnitude of charge on one electron, $e = -1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C.</li>
<li>Charge on $n$ electrons, $q = ne = n \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C.</li>
<li>Magnitude of charge on one proton, $e = +1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C.</li>
</ul>

## <span class="sub-header">Electric Current</span>

It is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge through any cross-section of a conductor in unit time.

If $q$ amount of charges flows through a conductor in $t$ time, then

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle \text{Electric current } (I) = \frac{\text{Charge } (q)}{\text{Time } (t)} = \frac{ne}{t} \quad [\because q = ne]$
</div>

where, $n$ = number of electrons flowing through the conductor.

<div class="note-box">
<b>Note: Static and Current Electricity</b> — Static electricity deals with the electric charges at rest, while the current electricity deals with the electric charges in motion.
</div>

- It is a <b>scalar quantity</b>. The SI unit of electric current is <b>ampere (A)</b>, named in honour of French scientist Andre-Marie Ampere (1775-1836).

- When 1 coulomb of charge flows through any cross-section of a conductor in 1 second, then the electric current flowing through it is said to be <b>1 ampere</b>.

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle 1 \text{ ampere} = \frac{1 \text{ coulomb}}{1 \text{ second}}$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle 1 \text{ A} = \frac{1 \text{ C}}{1 \text{ s}} = 1 \text{ Cs}^{-1}$
</div>

- Smaller units of current are <b>milliampere</b> ($1 \text{ mA} = 10^{-3}$ A) and <b>microampere</b> ($1 \mu\text{A} = 10^{-6}$ A).

## <span class="sub-header">Direction of Electric Current</span>

The direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons (negative charges). In an electric circuit, the current flows from positive terminal of the cell to the negative terminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

<div class="note-box">
<b>Ammeter</b> — Electric current is measured by a device called ammeter. It is a low resistance device which is always connected in series with the device through which the current is to be measured.

## <span class="sub-header">Solved Examples</span>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 1.</span> A current of 150 mA flows through a circuit for 2 min. Find the amount of charge that flows through the circuit.
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, current, $I = 150 \text{ mA} = 150 \times 10^{-3}$ A
<br/><br/>
Time, $t = 2 \text{ min} = 2 \times 60 = 120$ s
<br/><br/>
Amount of charge, $q = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that, $q = I \times t$
<br/><br/>
$\Rightarrow q = 150 \times 10^{-3} \times 120 \Rightarrow q = 18$ C
<br/><br/>
So, <b>18 C</b> of charge flows around the circuit.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 2.</span> A total of $6\times 10^{46}$ electrons flow through a current carrying conductor when connected through an external power supply for 20 s. Find the value of current in the conductor.
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, total number of electrons, $n = 6 \times 10^{46}$ electrons
<br/><br/>
Time, $t = 20$ s, Current, $I = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that, $q = ne$ ... (i)
<br/><br/>
and $I = \frac{q}{t}$ ... (ii)
<br/><br/>
From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we get
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle I = \frac{ne}{t} = \frac{6 \times 10^{46} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{20} \quad [\because e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}]$
<br/><br/>
$= 0.48 \times 10^{27}$ A $= 4.8 \times 10^{26}$ A
<br/><br/>
Thus, the current through the conductor is <b>$4.8 \times 10^{26}$ A</b>.
