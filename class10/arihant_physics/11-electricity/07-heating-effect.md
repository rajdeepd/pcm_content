# <span class="section-header">11.7 Heating Effect of Electric Current</span>

When an electric current is passed through a conductor, heat is produced in it. This is known as <b>heating effect of electric current</b>. This is obtained by the transformation of electrical energy into heat energy, e.g. electric heater, electric iron, etc.

## <span class="sub-header">Calculation of Heat Generated in a Conductor</span>

Assuming a conductor as a resistance wire which resists the flow of current through it, so work must be done by the current source for continuous flow of the current.

Now, we will calculate the work done by the source when the current $I$ flows through a wire of resistance $R$.

When an electric charge $q$ moves against a potential difference $V$, then

<b>Amount of work,</b> $W = q \times V$ ... (i)

From definition of current, we know that,

$\displaystyle I = \frac{q}{t}$ or $q = I \times t$ ... (ii)

From Ohm's law,

$\displaystyle \frac{V}{I} = R$ or $V = IR$ ... (iii)

Substituting the values of $q$ and $V$ in Eq. (i), we get

$W = (I \times t) \times IR = I^2 Rt$

Assuming that all electrical work done or electrical energy consumed is converted into heat energy, i.e. heat produced.

So, heat produced is given by

<div class="formula-box">
$H = I^2 \times R \times t$
</div>

Thus, it is known as <b>Joule's law of heating</b>.

<div class="important-box">
<b>This law implies that heat produced in a resistor is</b>
<ul>
<li>(i) <b>directly proportional to the square of current</b> for a given resistance.</li>
<li>(ii) <b>directly proportional to the resistance</b> for a given current.</li>
<li>(iii) <b>directly proportional to the time</b> for which the current flows through the resistor.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="note-box">
<b>Note:</b> The total work done in maintaining an electric current in an electric circuit for a given time is known as <b>electrical energy</b>.

## <span class="sub-header">Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current</span>

Although heating effect of electric current causes undesirable loss of electrical energy, still there are some useful applications of it. Some of them are given below:

### In electrical heating appliances

All electrical heating appliances are based on the heating effect of current, e.g. appliances, such as electric iron, water heaters and geysers, room heaters, toaster, hot plates are fitted with heating coils made of high resistance wire such as nichrome wire.

### Electric Filament Bulb

Electric bulb glows due to heating effect of electric current. In the glass shell of an electric bulb, there is a high resistance and high melting point tungsten wire, known as <b>filament</b>. When current flows through its filament, it gets heated up and starts emitting light.

The filament is thermally isolated and the bulb is filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gas to prolong the life of filament.

### Electric Fuse

An electric fuse is an electric device which is connected in series with the main supply and interrupts the flow of current in an electric circuit.

Fuse wire is made up of <b>low melting alloy of lead and tin</b>.

When large amount of current passes through the circuit, the fuse wire gets heated up and melts away. As a result, the circuit is broken and further damage is prevented.

Fuses are always rated for different current values such as 1A, 2A, 5A, 10A, 15A, etc.

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 15.</span> An electric iron of resistance $25\Omega$ takes a current of 7 A. Calculate the heat developed in 0.5 min.
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, resistance, $R = 25\Omega$, current, $I = 7$ A
<br/><br/>
Time, $t = 0.5$ min $= 0.5 \times 60 = 30$ s, heat, $H = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that, heat, $H = I^2Rt$
<br/><br/>
$H = (7)^2 \times 25 \times 30 = 36750$ J
<br/><br/>
$= 368 \times 10^4$ J $= $ <b>$3.68 \times 10^4$ J</b>
<br/><br/>
So, the heat developed is $3.68 \times 10^4$ J.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 16.</span> 200 J of heat is produced in 10 s in a $5\Omega$ resistance. Find the potential difference across the resistor.
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, heat, $H = 200$ J, resistance, $R = 5\Omega$
<br/><br/>
Time, $t = 10$ s, potential difference, $V = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that,
<br/><br/>
Heat, $H = I^2Rt$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle \Rightarrow \text{Current, } I = \sqrt{\frac{H}{Rt}} = \sqrt{\frac{200}{5 \times 10}} = 2$ A
<br/><br/>
So, potential difference across the resistor,

# <span class="section-header">11.8 Electric Power</span>

It is defined as the amount of electric energy consumed in a circuit per unit time.

If $W$ be the amount of electric energy consumed in a circuit in $t$ seconds, then the electric power is given by

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle P = \frac{W}{t}$
</div>

But, $W$ = electric energy $= Vq = VIt$ $[\because q = It]$

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle \therefore P = \frac{VIt}{t}$
<br/><br/>
$\Rightarrow P = VI$
</div>

The SI unit of electric power is <b>watt (W)</b>. It is named in honour of James Watt, a Scottish inventor.

<b>1 watt</b> of power is consumed, when 1 ampere of current flows at a potential difference of 1 volt.

<div class="formula-box">
$1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ V} \times 1 \text{ A} = 1 \text{ VA}$
</div>

<div class="note-box">
<b>Note:</b> The larger unit of electric power is <b>kilowatt (kW)</b>.
<br/><br/>
$1 \text{ kW} = 1000 \text{ W}$
</div>

According to Ohm's law, $V = IR$

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle \therefore P = IR \times I = I^2R \Rightarrow = \frac{V^2}{R} \quad \left[\because I = \frac{V}{R}\right]$
</div>

- The SI unit of electric power is <b>watt (W)</b>.

- It is said to be <b>1 watt</b>, if 1 ampere current flows through a circuit having 1 volt potential difference.
  <br/>i.e. $1 \text{ watt} = 1 \text{ volt} \times 1 \text{ ampere} = 1 \text{ VA}$

- <b>Electrical energy</b> is the product of power and time,
  <br/>i.e. $E = P \times T$
  <br/>Therefore, its unit will be <b>watt hour (W-h)</b>.

- <b>One watt-hour</b> is the energy consumed in which 1 watt of power is used for one hour.

- <b>Bigger units of power</b> are as given below:
  - 1 kilowatt (kW) $= 10^3$ W
  - 1 megawatt (MW) $= 10^6$ W
  - 1 gigawatt (GW) $= 10^9$ W

- <b>Practical unit of power</b> is horse power.
  <br/>1 HP = 746 W

## <span class="sub-header">Commercial Unit of Electrical Energy</span>

<b>One kilowatt hour</b> is the electrical energy consumed by an appliances of 1000 watts when used for one hour.

$1 \text{ kWh} = 1000 \text{ W-h} = 1000 \times 3600 \text{ W-s}$

<div class="formula-box">
$= 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ W-s} = 3.6 \times 10^6 \text{ J}$
</div>

- <b>Number of units consumed by electric appliances</b>

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle = \frac{\text{watt} \times \text{hours}}{1000}$
</div>

<div class="note-box">
<b>Are electrons already consumed in an electric circuit?</b>
<br/><br/>
No, electrons are not consumed in an electric circuit. We have to pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy, which moves electrons through all the electric gadgets like fan, bulb, refrigerator, etc., installed in our homes. <b>We pay for the electrical energy that we use.</b>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 17.</span> An electric fan runs from the 220 V mains. The current flowing through it is 0.6 A. At what rate is the electrical energy transformed by the fan? How much energy is transformed in 2 min?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, potential difference, $V = 220$ V
<br/><br/>
Current, $I = 0.6$ A
<br/><br/>
Time, $t = 2$ min $= 120$ s
<br/><br/>
Power, $P = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that,
<br/><br/>
Power, $P = VI = 220 \times 0.6 = 132$ W
<br/><br/>
and $E = Pt = 132 \times 120 = 15840$ J
<br/><br/>
So, the power of fan is <b>132 W</b> and it transforms <b>15840 J</b> of energy.

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 18.</span> An electric refrigerator rated 500 W operates 6 h/day. What is the cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at ₹4.5 per kWh?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Energy consumed by refrigerator in 30 days
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle = 500 \text{ W} \times 6 \frac{\text{h}}{\text{day}} \times 30 \text{ days}$
<br/><br/>
$= 90000$ W-h $= 90$ kWh
<br/><br/>
$\therefore$ Cost of energy to operate the refrigerator for 30 days
<br/><br/>
$= 90 \text{ kWh} \times ₹4.5 \text{ per kWh} = $ <b>₹405</b>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 19.</span> An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 880W, when heating is at the maximum rate and 340W, when the heating is at the minimum. The voltage is 220V. What are the current and the resistance in each case?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, $P_{\text{max}} = 880$ W
<br/><br/>
$P_{\text{min}} = 340$ W
<br/><br/>
$V = 220$ V
<br/><br/>
Power, $P = VI \Rightarrow$ current, $\displaystyle I = \frac{P}{V}$
<br/><br/>
<b>(i) When heating is at the maximum rate,</b>
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle I = \frac{P_{\text{max}}}{V} = \frac{880}{220} = $ <b>4 A</b>
<br/><br/>
Resistance of the electric iron, $\displaystyle R = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{220}{4} = $ <b>55 Ω</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>(ii) When heating is at the minimum rate,</b>
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle I = \frac{P_{\text{min}}}{V} = \frac{340}{220} = $ <b>1.54 A</b>
