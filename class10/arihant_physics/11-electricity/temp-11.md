Multiple Choice Questions
1 A current of 4.8 A is flowing in a conductor. The number of electrons passing per second through the conductor will be
(a) $3 \times 10^{20}$
(b) $76.8 \times 10^{20}$
(c) $7.68 \times 10^{-19}$
(d) $3 \times 10^{19}$

Sol. (d) Given, current, $I=48 \mathrm{~A}, e=16 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$
We know that, $I=\frac{q}{t}=\frac{n e}{t}$

$$
\therefore \quad \frac{n}{t}=\frac{I}{e}=\frac{48}{16 \times 10^{-19}}=3 \times 10^{19}
$$

Sol. (a) Given, current (I) drawn by the filament is 1 A .
We know that, $Q=n e$ and $Q=I t$

（b）

CBSE 2019

（c）

（d）

Sol．（c）Option（c）represents correct set－up for studying the dependence of the current on the potential difference across a resistor because ammeter $A$ is connected in series while voltmeter $V$ is connected across parallel to resistor $R$ ．
5 Identify the circuit in which the electrical components have been properly connected．

Competency Based Que．

Sol．（b）While identifying the circuit，the following conditions must be satisfied
I．An ammeter is always connected in series．
II．Voltmeter should be connected in parallel．
III．The positive terminals of voltmeter and ammeter should be joined to positive terminal of the cell and their negative terminals should be joined to the negative terminal of the cell．
Thus，the above conditions are satisfied in case（ii）．
6 A student carries out an experiment and plots the V－1 graph of three samples of nlchrome wire with resistances $R_1, R_2$ and $R_3$ respectively as shown in figure．Which of the following is true？

NCERT Exemplar
（a）$R_1=R_2=R_3$
（b）$R_1>R_2>R_3$
（c）$R_3>R_2>R_1$
（d）$R_2>R_3>R_1$
Sol．（c）We know that，slope of $V$ and $I$ tells about the resistance and（slope of $V$ and $I) \propto \frac{1}{\text { Resistance }}$ i．e．

So，

$$
R_3>R_2>R_1
$$


7

Plastic insulation surrounds a wire having diameter d and length／as shown above．A decrease in the resistance of the wire would be produced by an increase in the

Competency Based Que．
（a）length $l$ of the wire
（b）diameter $d$ of the wire
（c）temperature of the wire
（d）thickness of the plastic insulation
Sol．（b）The resistance $R$ of a wire having length $l$ and area of cross－section $A$ is given by

$$
R-\rho \frac{l}{A}=\rho \frac{l}{\frac{\pi}{4} d^2}=\rho \cdot \frac{4 l}{\pi d^2}
$$

where，$\rho=$ resistivity of wire．

$$
\therefore \quad R \propto \frac{1}{d^2}
$$


Hence，as diameter increases，the resistance of a wire decreases．

8 A cylindrical conductor of length / and uniform area of cross-section $A$ has resistance $R$ Another conductor of length 2.5 land resistance $0.5 R$ of the same material has area of cross-section

CBSE 2020
(a) 5 A
(b) 2.5 A
(c) 0.5 A
(d) $\frac{1}{5} \mathrm{~A}$

Sol. (a) As, resistance of a conductor,

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& R=\rho \frac{l}{A} \\
\Rightarrow & A=\rho \frac{l}{R}
\end{array}
$$


Given, conductor of length 2.5 l and resistance $0.5 R$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & 0.5 R=\rho \frac{2.5 l}{A^{\prime}} \\
\Rightarrow & A^{\prime}=\rho \frac{2.5 l}{0.5 R}
\end{array}
$$


From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we get

$$
\frac{A^{\prime}}{A}=\frac{\rho\left(\frac{2.5 l}{0.5 R}\right)}{\rho\left(\frac{l}{R}\right)} \Rightarrow A^{\prime}=5 A
$$


9 In case of four wires of same material, the resistance will be minimum, if the diameter and length of the wire respectively are

CBSE 2024
(a) $D / 2$ and $L / 4$
(b) $D / 4$ and $4 L$
(c) $2 D$ and $L$
(d) $4 D$ and $2 L$

Sol. (d) $4 D$ and $2 L$
Resistance of a given wire is

$$
R=\frac{\rho L}{A}
$$

where, $\rho \rightarrow$ Resistivity of the material
$L \rightarrow$ Length of wire.
$A \rightarrow$ Cross-section area of wire.

$$
R=\rho \frac{L}{\pi\left(\frac{D}{2}\right)^2} \Rightarrow R \approx \frac{L}{D^2}
$$


For values of diameter $4 D$ and length $2 L$ of wire

$$
R=\frac{2 L}{(4 D)^2}=\frac{2 L}{16 D^2}
$$

$R=\frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{L}{D^2}\right)$ is minimum among the other cases.
10 A cylindrical conductor of length / and uniform area of cross section $A$ has resistance $R$. The area of cross-section of another conductor of same material and same resistance but of length $2 I$ is

CBSE 2020
(a) $\frac{A}{2}$
(b) $\frac{3 A}{2}$
(c) $2 A$
(d) $3 A$

(a)

(c)

Sol. (c) As resistance of a conductor.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& R=\rho \frac{l}{A} \\
\Rightarrow & A=\rho \frac{l}{R}
\end{aligned}
$$


Given, another conductor of

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad R^{\prime}=R, l^{\prime}=2 l \text { and } \rho^{\prime}=\rho \\
& \text { Then, } \quad R^{\prime}=\rho^{\prime} \frac{l^{\prime}}{A^{\prime}} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad R=\rho \frac{2 l}{A^{\prime}} \\
& \Rightarrow \quad A^{\prime}=\rho \frac{2 l}{R}
\end{aligned}
$$


From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we get

$$
\frac{A^{\prime}}{A}=\frac{\rho \frac{2 l}{R}}{\rho \frac{l}{R}} \Rightarrow A^{\prime}=2 A
$$


11 A complete circult is left on for several minutes. causing the connecting copper wire to become hot. As the temperature of the wire increases, the electrical resistance of the wire

CBSE SQP 2022-23
(a) decreases
(b) remains the same
(c) increases
(d) increases for sometime and then decreases

Sol. (c) The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to temperature. So, as the wire becomes hot, its temperature increases and hence resistance also increases.
12 Raman wants to draw a graph to show how the resistivity $(\rho)$ of a wire changes with the length ( $\rho$ ) of the wire. What should his graph look like?
