# Assertion-Reasoning Questions - Electricity

## Instructions

**Direction:** In each of the following questions, a statement of Assertion (A) is given by the corresponding statement of Reason (R). Of the statements, mark the correct answer as:

- **(a)** If both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation of Assertion.
- **(b)** If both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion.
- **(c)** If Assertion is true but Reason is false.
- **(d)** If Assertion is false but Reason is true.

#### Q.1

**Assertion (A):** When the length of a wire is doubled, then its resistance also gets doubled.

**Reason (R):** The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length.

**Sol.** (a) The resistance of wire, $R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$

i.e. $R \propto l$

Since, the resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length, i.e. when the length of a wire is doubled/halved, then its resistance also gets doubled/halved.

#### Q.2

**Assertion (A):** The conducting wires are made of copper.

**Reason (R):** The electrical conductivity of copper is high.

**Sol.** (a) Copper conducts the current without offering much resistance due to high electrical conductivity. Hence, conducting wires are made of copper.

**Assertion (A):** At high temperatures, metal wires have a greater chance of short circuiting.

**Reason (R):** Both resistance and resistivity of a material vary with temperature.

**Sol.** (a) At high temperature, chances of short circuiting increase due to increase in resistance and resistivity of material.

**Assertion (A):** Alloys are commonly used in electrical heating devices like electric iron and heater.

**Reason (R):** Resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals but the alloys have lower melting points than their constituent metals.

**Sol.** (c) The resistivity and melting point of alloys are higher than their constituent metals, so alloys are commonly used in electrical heating devices like electric iron and heater.

#### Q.5

**Assertion (A):** Heater wire must have high resistance and high melting point.

**Reason (R):** If resistance is high, then electrical conductivity will be less.

**Sol.** (a) Heater wire must have high resistance and high melting point, because in series, current remains same. According to Joule's law, $H = I^2 R t$. Heat produced is high if $R$ is high, therefore melting point must be high, so that wire may not melt with increase in temperature.

#### Q.6

**Assertion (A):** The 200 W bulb glow with more brightness than 100 W bulbs.

**Reason (R):** A 100 W bulb has more resistance than 200 W bulb.

**Sol.** (a) Resistance, $R = \frac{V^2}{P}$

$$R \propto \frac{1}{P}$$

i.e. Higher the wattage of a bulb, lesser is the resistance and so it will glow bright.

---

#### Q.7

**Assertion (A):** A voltmeter and ammeter can be used to measure both the resistance and power.

**Reason (R):** Power is proportional to voltage and current.

**Sol.** (b) Resistance, $R = \frac{V}{I}$

Power, $P = V I$

We can measure both resistance and power by measuring the $V$ and $I$ simultaneously in circuit. So, option (b) is correct.
