# <span class="section-header">11.3 Electric Circuit</span>

A closed and continuous path through which electric current flows is known as electric circuit.

It consists of various components like:
- a source of current (say a cell or battery)
- a load (say a bulb or any other appliance)
- a switch/key (to open or close a circuit)
- a fuse

These all are connected through connecting wires and these wires are generally made of copper.
