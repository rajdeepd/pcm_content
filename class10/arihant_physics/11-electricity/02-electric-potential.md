# <span class="section-header">11.2 Electric Potential and Potential Difference</span>

## <span class="sub-header">Electric Potential</span>

It is defined as the amount of work done when a unit positive charge is moved from infinity to a point.

If work done in moving a positive charge $q$ from infinity to a point is $W$, then electric potential $V$ of that point is

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle V = \frac{W}{q}$
</div>

The SI unit of electric potential is <b>volt (V)</b> and is named after Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745-1827). It is a scalar quantity.

## <span class="sub-header">Electric Potential Difference ($\Delta V$)</span>

The flow of charges in conducting wire is only possible, when there is a potential difference across the terminals of the cell. So, the <b>electric potential difference</b> between two points is defined as the work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another point.

The electric potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor is said to be <b>1 volt</b>, if 1 joule of work is done in moving 1 coulomb of electric charge from one point to another point.

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle 1 \text{ volt} = \frac{1 \text{ joule}}{1 \text{ coulomb}}$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle 1 \text{ V} = \frac{1 \text{ J}}{1 \text{ C}} = 1 \text{ JC}^{-1}$
</div>

<div class="important-box">
<b>Units of Electric Potential:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Smaller units:</b> $1 \text{ mV} = 10^{-3}$ V, $1 \mu\text{V} = 10^{-6}$ V</li>
<li><b>Larger units:</b> $1 \text{ kV} = 10^3$ V, $1 \text{ MV} = 10^6$ V</li>
</ul>
</div>

## <span class="sub-header">Voltmeter</span>

The electric potential difference between two points in a circuit is measured by using a device called <b>voltmeter</b>. It is a high resistance device which is always connected in parallel with the component(s) through which potential difference is to be measured.

## <span class="sub-header">Solved Examples</span>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 3.</span> How much work is done in moving a charge of 3 C across two points having a potential difference 15 V?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, charge, $q = 3$ C and potential difference, $\Delta V = 15$ V
<br/><br/>
The amount of work done in moving the charge,
<br/><br/>
$W = Vq = 15 \times 3 = $ <b>45 J</b>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 4.</span> Calculate the potential difference between two terminals of a battery, if 100 J of work is required to transfer the charge of 20 C from one terminal of the battery to the other.
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, work done, $W = 100$ J, charge, $q = 20$ C
<br/><br/>
Potential difference, $\Delta V = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that, $\displaystyle \Delta V = \frac{W}{q} = \frac{100}{20} = 5$ V
<br/><br/>
The potential difference between two points is <b>5 V</b>.
</div>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 5.</span> How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C from a point of 118 V to a point at 128 V?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, charge, $q = 2$ C
<br/><br/>
Potential at point A, $V_A = 118$ V
<br/><br/>
Potential at point B, $V_B = 128$ V
<br/><br/>
Work done, $W = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that,
<br/><br/>
Potential difference, $\Delta V = V_B - V_A = 128 - 118 = 10$ V
<br/><br/>
$\therefore$ Work done, $W = \Delta V \times q = 10 \times 2 = $ <b>20 J</b>
