# <span class="section-header">11.5 Resistance</span>

It is that property of a conductor by virtue of which it opposes/resists the flow of charges/flow of current through it.

Its SI unit is <b>ohm</b> and is represented by the Greek letter $\Omega$.

<b>According to Ohm's law,</b>

Resistance of a conductor is given by $\displaystyle R = \frac{V}{I}$.

From the above formula, it is clear that <b>current is inversely proportional to resistance</b>. If resistance is doubled, then current gets halved and if resistance is halved, then current gets doubled.

It is said to be <b>1 ohm</b>, if a potential difference of 1 volt across the ends of the conductor makes a current of 1 ampere to flow through it.

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle 1 \text{ ohm} = \frac{1 \text{ volt}}{1 \text{ ampere}}$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle 1\Omega = \frac{1 \text{ V}}{1 \text{ A}} = 1 \text{ VA}^{-1}$

## <span class="sub-header">Some Important Terms Related to Resistance</span>

Some important terms related to resistance are as follows:

<div class="term-box">
<b>■ Resistor</b> — A component in an electric circuit which offers resistance to the flow of electrons constituting electric current is known as resistor. These are used to make those electrical devices, where high resistance is required. It reduces current in a circuit, e.g. alloys like nichrome, manganin and constantan.
</div>

<div class="term-box">
<b>■ Rheostat/Variable resistance</b> — It is a variable resistor, which is used to control the flow of electric current by manually increasing or decreasing the resistance.
</div>

<div class="term-box">
<b>■ Good conductor</b> — A material which offers low resistance to the flow of electrons or electric current in an electric circuit is known as a good conductor, e.g. silver, copper, aluminium. Amongst these, <b>silver is the best conductor of electricity</b>.
</div>

<div class="term-box">
<b>■ Poor conductor</b> — A material which offers higher resistance than conductors to the flow of electrons or electric current in an electric circuit is known as poor conductor, e.g. mercury, lead, stainless steel, alloys of iron and chromium.
</div>

<div class="term-box">
<b>■ Insulator</b> — A material which offers very high resistance to the flow of electrons or electric current in an electric circuit is known as insulator, e.g. rubber, dry wood and plastic. Electric current does not flow through them.
</div>

## <span class="sub-header">Factors on which the Resistance of a Conductor Depends</span>

The electrical resistance of a conductor depends on the following factors:

### (i) Length of the conductor

The resistance of a conductor $R$ is directly proportional to its length $l$.

<div class="formula-box">
$R \propto l \quad ...(i)$
</div>

Since, the <b>resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length</b>, i.e. when the length of a wire is doubled/halved, then its resistance also gets doubled/halved.

### (ii) Area of cross-section of the conductor

The resistance of a conductor $R$ is inversely proportional to its area of cross-section $A$.

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle R \propto \frac{1}{A} \quad ...(ii)$
</div>

Since, the <b>resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its area of cross-section</b> i.e., when the area of cross-section of wire is doubled, then its resistance gets halved and if area of cross-section of wire is halved, then its resistance will get doubled.

<div class="note-box">
<b>Note:</b> When a conductor is stretched (increased its length), then its area of cross-section decreases accordingly but the volume (i.e. area × length) of the conductor remains same.
</div>

### (iii) Nature of the material of the conductor

The resistance of a conductor depends on the nature of the material of which it is made. Some materials have low resistance, whereas others have high resistance.

Therefore, from Eqs. (i) and (ii), we can write

<div class="formula-box">
$\displaystyle R \propto \frac{l}{A} \quad \text{or} \quad R = \rho \frac{l}{A}$
</div>

where, $\rho$ is the constant of proportionality and it is called <b>electric resistivity</b> or <b>specific resistance</b> of the material of the conductor.

## <span class="sub-header">Resistivity</span>

The resistance offered by a wire of unit length and unit cross-sectional area is called resistivity. Its SI unit is <b>ohm-metre</b>.

<b>The resistivity of a material does not depend on its length or thickness but depends on the nature of the substance and temperature.</b>

<div class="important-box">
<ul>
<li><b>Insulators</b> such as glass, rubber, ebonite, etc., have a <b>very high resistivity</b> ($10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ Ω-m), while</li>
<li><b>Conductors</b> such as silver, copper, etc., have a <b>very low resistivity</b> ($10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ Ω-m).</li>
<li><b>Alloys</b> have <b>higher resistivity</b> than that of their constituent metals. They do not oxidise easily at high temperatures, this is why they are used to make heating elements of devices such as electric iron, heaters, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="note-box">
<b>Note:</b> Tungsten is almost used exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.
</div>

## <span class="sub-header">Solved Examples</span>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 6.</span> The potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater is 75 V when it draws a current of 5 A from the source. What current will the heater draw, if the potential difference is increased to 150 V?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, potential difference, $V = 75$ V
<br/><br/>
Current, $I = 5$ A
<br/><br/>
We know that, $\displaystyle R = \frac{V}{I} \Rightarrow R = \frac{75}{5} = 15\Omega$
<br/><br/>
When potential difference is increased to 150 V, then the current,
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle I' = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{150}{15} = $ <b>10 A</b>
</div>

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 7.</span> A wire of given material having length $l$ and area of cross-section $A$ has a resistance of $10\Omega$. What would be the resistance of another wire of the same material having length $l/4$ and area of cross-section $2.5A$?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> For first wire, length $= l$, area of cross-section $= A$ and resistance, $R_1 = 10\Omega$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle R_1 = \frac{\rho l}{A} = 10\Omega$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle \Rightarrow \rho = \frac{10A}{l} \quad ...(i)$
<br/><br/>
For second wire, length $= l/4$, area of cross-section $= 2.5A$
<br/><br/>
$\displaystyle \therefore \text{Resistance, } R_2 = \rho \frac{l/4}{2.5A} = \frac{10A}{l} \cdot \frac{l}{4 \times 2.5A} \quad \text{[from Eq. (i)]}$

<div class="example-box">
<span class="example-title">Example 8.</span> Resistance of a metal wire of length 2 m is $30\Omega$ at temperature $25°$C. If the diameter of the wire is 0.6 mm, then what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature?
<br/><br/>
<b>Sol.</b> Given, length of wire, $l = 2$ m
<br/><br/>
Resistance, $R = 30\Omega$
<br/><br/>
Temperature, $T = 25°$C
<br/><br/>
Diameter of wire, $d = 0.6 \text{ mm} = 6 \times 10^{-4}$ m
<br/><br/>
Resistivity of the wire, $\rho = ?$
<br/><br/>
We know that, $\displaystyle \rho = \frac{RA}{l} = \frac{R\pi d^2}{4l}$ $\quad \left[\because A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}\right]$

$\displaystyle = \frac{30 \times \pi \times (6 \times 10^{-4})^2}{4 \times 2}$
