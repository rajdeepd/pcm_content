# NCERT Intext Questions - Electricity

#### Q.1 What does an electric circuit mean?

**Sol.** A closed and continuous path of electric current is known as electric circuit.

---

#### Q.2 Define the unit of electric current.

**Sol.** The SI unit of electric current is ampere (A). The amount of current flowing through a conductor is said to be 1 ampere, if a charge of 1coulomb (C) flows through it in 1 second (s).

$$\text{i.e. } 1C = 1A \times 1s$$

or

$$1A = \frac{1C}{1s}$$

---

#### Q.3 Calculate the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge.

**Sol.** We know that, charge on one electron = $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ C

$\Rightarrow 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulomb charge = 1 electron.

$$\therefore 1 \text{ coulomb charge} = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 6.25 \times 10^{18} \text{ electrons}$$

#### Q.4 Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor.

**Sol.** Electric cell or battery is a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a conductor.

---

#### Q.5 What is meant by saying that the potential difference between two points is 1 volt?

**Sol.** The potential difference between two points is said to be 1 volt, if 1 joule of work is done in moving 1 coulomb of electric charge from one point to another point.

---

#### Q.6 How much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a 6 V battery?

**Sol.** Given, charge, $q = 1$ C, potential, $V = 6$ V, $W = ?$

As we know, $W = q V = 1 \times 6 = 6$ J

6 J is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a 6V battery.

---

#### Q.7 On what factors does the resistance of a conductor depend?

**Sol.** The resistance of a conductor depends on following factors
- (i) Length of the conductor.
- (ii) Area of cross-section of the conductor.
- (iii) Nature of material of the conductor.

---

#### Q.8 Will current flow more easily through a thick wire or a thin wire of the same material, when connected to the same source? Why?

**Sol.** Resistance is inversely proportional to the area of cross-section of the wire. Since, thick wire has a **large area of cross-section, its resistance will be less**. Thus, current will flow more easily through the **thick wire**.

---

#### Q.9 Let the resistance of an electrical component remains constant while the potential difference across the two ends of the component decreases to half of its former value. What change will occur in the current through it?

**Sol.** Let resistance be R and potential difference V across the two ends becomes V/2. Since,

$$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{V}{R}$$

As $V \rightarrow V/2$, $I = \frac{V}{2R} = \frac{1}{2}I$

In other words, current through the component becomes half of its original value.

---

#### Q.10 Why are coils of electric toasters and electric irons made of alloy rather than a pure metal?

**Sol.** Alloys have a higher resistivity than their constituent metals. They do not oxidise or burn at higher temperatures as they have high melting point. Thus, they are used to make coils of electrical toasters and electric irons rather than pure metals.
