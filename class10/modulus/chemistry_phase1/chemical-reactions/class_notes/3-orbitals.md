## Orbitals

There are four distinct types of orbitals: s, p, d, and f, each possessing a unique shape. In organic and biological chemistry, s and p orbitals are most frequently encountered. An s-orbital is spherical with the nucleus at its center, while a p-orbital is dumbbell-shaped. Four of the five d orbitals exhibit a cloverleaf shape, and the fifth d orbital is characterized by an elongated dumbbell form with a doughnut-like ring around its middle. The orbitals within an atom are arranged into various layers, known as electron shells.

According to the quantum atomic model, an atom can contain numerous possible orbitals, which can be categorized by their size, shape, or orientation. A smaller orbital indicates a higher probability of locating an electron near the nucleus. The orbital wave function, denoted as $\phi$, is a mathematical function used to represent the coordinates of an electron. The square of the orbital wave function, $\phi^2$, represents the probability of finding an electron. This wave function is also instrumental in constructing boundary surface diagrams. These diagrams, which illustrate constant probability density for different orbitals, aid in understanding the shapes of orbitals.

### The Shape of s Orbitals

The boundary surface diagram for the s orbital resembles a sphere with the nucleus at its center, appearing as a circle in two dimensions. This indicates that s-orbitals are **spherically symmetric**, meaning the probability of finding an electron at a given distance from the nucleus is equal in all directions. The size of the s orbital increases with an increasing principal quantum number ($n$), following the order $4s > 3s > 2s > 1s$.

### The Shape of p Orbitals

Each p orbital is composed of two **lobes** situated on opposite sides of a plane passing through the nucleus. The three p orbitals are identical in terms of size, shape, and energy, but differ in their spatial orientation. Since the lobes align with either the x, y, or z-axis, these three orbitals are designated as $2p_x$, $2p_y$, and $2p_z$. Therefore, there are three p orbitals whose axes are mutually perpendicular. Similar to s orbitals, the size and energy of p orbitals increase with an increase in the principal quantum number (e.g., $4p > 3p > 2p$).
