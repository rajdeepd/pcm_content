### Definition of a Polynomial

An algebraic expression of the form $a_0+a_1 x+a_2 x^2+a_3 x^3+\ldots . .+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+a_n x^n$ is defined as a **polynomial** in $x$. In this expression, $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are **real numbers**, $n$ is a **non-negative integer**, and $x$ is a **variable**.

**Examples:**

  * $2 x^3+3 x-20$ and $4 x^2+5 x+6$ are polynomials in $x$.
  * $6 y^4-2 y^3+4 y-3$ and $2 y-4$ are polynomials in $y$.
  * Expressions like $7 x^2+2 \sqrt{x}-3$ and $y-\frac{1}{y}$ are not polynomials in $x$ and $y$, respectively, due to the presence of non-integer powers of the variable (e.g., $\\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$) or variables in the denominator (e.g., $\\frac{1}{y} = y^{-1}$).

Polynomials in $x$ are generally denoted by notations such as $f(x), g(x), h(x)$, etc.
**Examples:**

  * $f(x)=2 x^3+3 x-4$ is a polynomial in $x$.
  * $g(y)=2 y^2-6 y+1$ is a polynomial in $y$.

### Degree of a Polynomial

The **degree of a polynomial** $a_0+a_1 x+a_2 x^2+\ldots . .+a_n x^n$ is $n$, provided that $a_n \\neq 0$. In simpler terms, it is the highest power of $x$ (the variable) in the polynomial.

**Examples:**

  * The degree of $2 x+3$ is 1.
  * The degree of $2 y^3+y^2-6 y+10$ is 3.
  * The degree of a non-zero constant polynomial (e.g., $f(x)=4$) is '0'.

### Terms and Coefficients of a Polynomial

For a polynomial $f(x)=a_0+a_1 x+a_2 x^2+\ldots . .+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+a_n x^n$:

  * The numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are called **coefficients**.
  * $a_0$ is specifically referred to as the **constant term**.
  * $a_n$ is called the **leading coefficient** (the coefficient of the term with the highest power of the variable).
  * The individual parts $a_0, a_1 x, a_2 x^2, \ldots, a_n x^n$ are called **terms** of the polynomial.

**Example:**
In the polynomial $3 x^2-4 x+5$:

  * $3$ is the leading coefficient.
  * $5$ is the constant term.
  * The coefficients are $3$ (of $x^2$), $-4$ (of $x$), and $5$ (the constant term).
  * The terms are $3 x^2$, $-4 x$, and $5$.

## Types of Polynomials

Polynomials can be classified based on their **degree** or the **number of terms** they contain.

| Classification of Polynomials | Based on Degree                                     | Based on Terms                               |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| (1)                           | A polynomial with degree '0' is called a **constant polynomial**. <br\> Ex: $f(x)=4$, $g(y)=\frac{4}{3}$ | A polynomial with '1' term is called a **monomial**. <br\> Ex: $f(x)=2 x^2$ |
Here's the reformatted content, presented in a more readable and structured way:

**Zero Polynomial**

A polynomial where all coefficients are '0' is called a **zero polynomial**, i.e., $f(x) = 0$. The degree of a zero polynomial is **not defined**.

-----

**Value of a Polynomial**

The value of a polynomial $f(x)$ at $x=a$ is obtained by substituting $x=a$ into $f(x)$ and is denoted by $f(a)$.

**Example:**
If $f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 4$, then $f(2) = ?$

**Solution:**
$$f(2) = 2^2 + 3(2) + 4 = 4 + 6 + 4 = 14$$
Therefore, the value of $f(x)$ at $x=2$ is $14$.

-----

**Zeros or Roots of a Polynomial**

If the value of a polynomial $f(x)$ becomes zero at $x=a$, then 'a' is called a **zero of $f(x)$** or a **root of $f(x)=0$**.

**Example-1:**
If $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$, then $f(3) = ?$

**Solution:**
Solution

$
f(2)=2^2+6+4=14
$


Therefore, $x=3$ is a zero of $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$ or a root of $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$.

**Find the roots of the polynomials:**

**(a) $x^3 - 8$**

**Solution:**
Set the polynomial to zero to find the root:
$x^3 - 8 = 0$   
$x^3 = 8$.      
$x^3 = 2^3$.  
Therefore, $x=2$ is a root of the polynomial equation $x^3 - 8 = 0$.

**(b) $16x^2 - 1$**

**Solution:**
Set the polynomial to zero:
$
\begin{array}{ll}
x^3-8=0 & \Rightarrow x^3=8 \\
& \Rightarrow x^3-2^3
\end{array}
$


Therefore, $x = \frac{1}{4}$ and $x = -\frac{1}{4}$ are the roots of the polynomial equation $16x^2 - 1 = 0$.

**Example-3:**
If $x=3$ is a root of $x^2 + 5x + k = 0$, then find the value of $k$.

**Solution:**
Since $x=3$ is a root of $f(x) = x^2 + 5x + k$, it means that $f(3) = 0$.

$
3^2 + 5(3) + k = 0 \newline
9 + 15 + k = 0 \newline

k = -24  \newline
$

2.  **Which of the following are polynomials?**
    * (i) $x^3 - x$ **(Polynomial)**
    * (ii) $x^{3/2} + x$ **(Not a polynomial, due to fractional exponent)**
    * (iii) $\sqrt{x} - 4$ **(Not a polynomial, as $\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}$ has a fractional exponent)**
    * (iv) $x + \frac{1}{x}$ **(Not a polynomial, as $\frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}$ has a negative exponent)**

3.  **If $x^3 + x^2 + 2x + k = 0$ has root 1, then $k = ?$**
