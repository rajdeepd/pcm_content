# C3 Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem

## Remainder Theorem

When we divide two integers, the remainder obtained is either zero or is less than the divisor. Similarly, when two polynomials are divided, the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor.

### Theorem

Let $P(x)$ be any polynomial of degree greater than or equal to one, and let $a$ be any real number. When $P(x)$ is divided by the binomial $(x-a)$, the remainder is $P(a)$.

**Proof:**

$P(x)$ can be written as:

$P(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)$

Where $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder.

Also, we know that $\text{deg}(r(x)) < \text{deg}(x-a)$ or $r(x) = 0$.

Since $\text{deg}(x-a) = 1$, the degree of $r(x)$ must be 0, which means $r(x)$ is a constant, let's denote it as $r$.

So, for $x=a$:

$P(a) = (a-a)q(a) + r$
$P(a) = 0 \cdot q(a) + r$

Hence:

$P(a) = r$

**Example**
Find the remainder when $f(x)=x^3+x^2+2 x+3$ is divided by $x+1$.

**Solution**
When $f(x)$ is divided by $x+1$, then the remainder is $f(-1)$.

$
\begin{aligned}
f(-1) &= (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 3 \newline
f(-1) &= -1 + 1 - 2 + 3 \newline
f(-1) &= 1
\end{aligned}
$

The remainder is $1$. Note that the degree of the remainder (0) is less than the degree of the divisor (1).

## Factor Theorem

Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree greater than or equal to $1$, and '$a$' be a real number such that $P(a)=0 \Rightarrow (x-a)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.

Conversely, if $(x-a)$ is a factor of $P(x)$, then $P(a)=0$.

### Proof:

Let $q(x)$ be the quotient when $P(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$.

From the Remainder Theorem, we know that $P(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)$, where $r(x) = P(a)$.
So, we can write $P(x) = (x-a)q(x) + P(a)$.

If $P(a) = 0$, then the equation becomes:  
$P(x) = (x-a)q(x) + 0$  
$P(x) = (x-a)q(x)$.  

This shows that if $P(a)=0$, then $(x-a)$ is a factor of $P(x)$.

**Example**
For what value of '$a$' is $(x-3)$ a factor of $f(x)=x^2-ax+9$?

**Solution**
If $(x-3)$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then by the Factor Theorem, $f(3)=0$.

Substitute $x=3$ into the polynomial $f(x)=x^2-ax+9$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(3) &= 3^2 - a(3) + 9 \\
0 &= 9 - 3a + 9 \\
0 &= 18 - 3a \\
3a &= 18 \\
a &= \frac{18}{3} \\
a &= 6
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, for $(x-3)$ to be a factor of $f(x)$, the value of $a$ must be $6$.

## Method to Factorize a Given Polynomial $P(x)$

To factorize a polynomial $P(x)$, follow these steps:

1.  **Find Factors of the Constant Term:** Identify the constant term in $P(x)$ and list all its possible integer factors (both positive and negative).

2.  **Test for Roots:** Substitute these factors into $P(x)$ to check which values make $P(x)$ equal to zero. These values are the roots of the polynomial.

3.  **Identify Factors:** If, by substituting $x=a$, the polynomial $P(x)$ becomes zero (i.e., $P(a)=0$), then $(x-a)$ is a factor of the polynomial, according to the Factor Theorem.

4.  **Formulate Partial Factorization:** If you find factors $(x-a_1), (x-a_2), (x-a_3), \ldots$, then you can write $P(x)$ in the form:
    $P(x) = k(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)\ldots$
    Here, $k$ is a numerical coefficient.

5.  **Determine the Leading Coefficient ($k$):** To find the value of $k$, substitute a suitable value for $x$ (any value other than $a_1, a_2, \ldots$) into both the original polynomial $P(x)$ and the partially factorized form. Solve for $k$. Alternatively, $k$ is simply the leading coefficient of the original polynomial $P(x)$.

6.  **Complete Factorization:** Substitute the determined value of $k$ back into the partial factorization to obtain the complete factorized form of the given polynomial.

Okay, let's break down points 5 and 6 of the "Method to Factorize a Given Polynomial $P(x)$" in more detail.

### Understanding Point 5: Determine the Leading Coefficient ($k$)

Point 5 states:
"If you find factors $(x-a_1), (x-a_2), (x-a_3), \ldots$, then you can write $P(x)$ in the form: $P(x) = k(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)\ldots$ Here, $k$ is a numerical coefficient. To find the value of $k$, substitute a suitable value for $x$ (any value other than $a_1, a_2, \ldots$) into both the original polynomial $P(x)$ and the partially factorized form. Solve for $k$. Alternatively, $k$ is simply the leading coefficient of the original polynomial $P(x)$."

Let's illustrate with an example. Suppose you have a polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 7x - 2$.
Following steps 1-3, you might find that $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, and $(x-0.5)$ are factors.

So, your partial factorization would look like:
$P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5)$

**Method 1: Using the leading coefficient (the simpler way)**

In any polynomial $P(x) = c_nx^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + c_1x + c_0$, the term $c_n$ is called the **leading coefficient**.

When you fully factorize a polynomial, the coefficient of the highest power of $x$ in the factored form must match the leading coefficient of the original polynomial.

In our example, $P(x) = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 7x - 2$, the leading coefficient is $2$.
If we multiply out $k(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5)$, the highest power of $x$ will come from multiplying $k \cdot x \cdot x \cdot x = kx^3$.
For this to match the original polynomial's leading term ($2x^3$), $k$ must be $2$.

So, **the numerical coefficient $k$ in the factored form will always be equal to the leading coefficient of the original polynomial $P(x)$**. This is the most straightforward way to find $k$.

**Method 2: Substituting a suitable value for $x$ (useful for verification or if you miss the leading coefficient directly)**

If for some reason you can't immediately spot the leading coefficient, or you want to double-check, you can pick any value of $x$ that is *not* one of your roots ($a_1, a_2, \ldots$) and substitute it into both the original $P(x)$ and your partially factored form.

Using our example: $P(x) = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 7x - 2$ and $P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5)$.
Let's choose $x=0$ (since 0 is not 1, 2, or 0.5).

Original polynomial at $x=0$:
$P(0) = 2(0)^3 - 7(0)^2 + 7(0) - 2 = -2$

Partially factored form at $x=0$:
$P(0) = k(0-1)(0-2)(0-0.5)$
$-2 = k(-1)(-2)(-0.5)$
$-2 = k(2)(-0.5)$
$-2 = k(-1)$
$2 = k$

Both methods give $k=2$. The first method (identifying the leading coefficient directly) is almost always quicker and simpler.

**Understanding Point 6: Complete Factorization**

Point 6 states:
"Substitute the value of $k$ in the above to get the factorized from of the given polynomial."

Once you have determined the value of $k$ from Point 5, you simply plug it back into your partially factored form.

Using our example where $k=2$ and factors are $(x-1)$, $(x-2)$, and $(x-0.5)$:

The partially factored form was: $P(x) = k(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5)$

Now, substitute $k=2$:
$P(x) = 2(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5)$

This is the fully factorized form of the polynomial $P(x) = 2x^3 - 7x^2 + 7x - 2$.

**In summary:**
* **Point 5** is about finding the scaling factor ($k$) that ensures the product of your linear factors (and $k$) precisely equals the original polynomial. This $k$ is always the leading coefficient of the original polynomial.
* **Point 6** is simply writing down the final, complete factorization by inserting the value of $k$ you found into the product of the linear factors.

Let's clarify the last two points in the method for factorizing a polynomial P(x). These steps are crucial for getting the complete and correct factorization.

### Point 5: Determining the Leading Coefficient (k)

When you've found all the linear factors of a polynomial, say (x-a1), (x-a2), and so on, you can write the polynomial as: P(x) = k(x-a1)(x-a2)... . Here, 'k' is a numerical coefficient that needs to be determined.

The simplest way to find 'k' is to remember that **'k' is always the same as the leading coefficient of your original polynomial P(x)**. The leading coefficient is the number in front of the highest power of 'x' in the polynomial.

For example, if your original polynomial is P(x) = **2**x^3 - 7x^2 + 7x - 2, the leading coefficient is **2**. So, in your factored form, 'k' will be **2**.

Alternatively, if you want to verify or if you're unsure about the leading coefficient, you can pick any value for 'x' (except for the roots you've already found, like a1, a2, etc.). Substitute this 'x' value into both the original P(x) and your partially factored form (k(x-a1)(x-a2)...). Then, solve the resulting equation for 'k'. Both methods will give you the same 'k' value.

---

### Point 6: Completing the Factorization

Once you've successfully found the value of 'k' from Point 5, the final step is straightforward: just **substitute this 'k' value back into your partially factored polynomial expression**.

For instance, if you determined that k=2 and your factors were (x-1), (x-2), and (x-0.5), your complete factorization would be: P(x) = 2(x-1)(x-2)(x-0.5).

This gives you the final, fully factorized form of the polynomial.

## Example-1

Let's factor the polynomial $P(x)=x^2-x-6$.

### Solution

First, we identify the **constant term**, which is -6. The possible integer factors of -6 are $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6$. These are our potential roots.

Next, we test these values to see which ones make $P(x)$ equal to zero:
* If $x=-2$: $P(-2) = (-2)^2 - (-2) - 6 = 4 + 2 - 6 = 0$. So, $(x+2)$ is a factor.
* If $x=3$: $P(3) = (3)^2 - (3) - 6 = 9 - 3 - 6 = 0$. So, $(x-3)$ is a factor.

For other potential factors like $\pm 1, +2, -3, \pm 6$, $P(x)$ does not equal 0.

Now we can write the polynomial in the form $P(x) = k(x+2)(x-3)$.
So, $x^2-x-6 = k(x+2)(x-3)$.

To find the value of $k$, we can look at the **leading coefficient** of the original polynomial $P(x)=x^2-x-6$. The coefficient of $x^2$ is 1. Therefore, $k=1$.

Alternatively, we can pick a convenient value for $x$ (not one of the roots we found, -2 or 3), say $x=1$, and substitute it into the equation:
$-6 = k(1+2)(1-3)$
$-6 = k(3)(-2)$
$-6 = -6k$
$k = 1$

Since $k=1$, we can write $P(x)$ as:
$P(x) = (1)(x+2)(x-3)$
$P(x) = (x+2)(x-3)$

So, the factored form of $x^2-x-6$ is $(x+2)(x-3)$.
