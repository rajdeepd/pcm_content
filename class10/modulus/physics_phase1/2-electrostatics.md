# ELECTROSTATICS

## Introduction

The charge and its motion have always been at the center of focus for scientists and engineers working in the field of electrical circuits. The motion or dynamics of charges, in particular, gives rise to some very interesting effects, which we tend to investigate in this chapter.

In this lesson, we discuss the ideas of electrical current and electrical resistance. The basic laws governing the current distribution in any electrical circuit are also discussed. We end this lesson by discussing the chemical, thermal, and thermoelectric effects of electrical current.

## ELECTROSTATICS

### Electric Charge

Charge is the physical property of certain fundamental particles (like electron, proton) by virtue of which they interact with other similar fundamental particles. These are solely responsible for electrical interaction as well as magnetic interaction in nature. The study of electrical interaction of charges at rest is referred to as electrostatics. To distinguish the nature of interaction, charges are divided into two types: (i) positive and (ii) negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. The SI unit of charge is coulomb, and its symbol is 'C'. The magnitude of the smallest known charge is $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$ (charge of one electron or proton).

**Note:** The true test of electrification is repulsion and not attraction, as attraction may also take place between a charged and an uncharged body, and also between two oppositely charged bodies.

### Properties Of Electric Charge

#### 1. Quantization of charge

Charge exists in discrete packets rather than in a continuous amount. That is, the charge on any body is an integral multiple of the charge on an electron.
$\Rightarrow Q = \pm ne$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$

#### 2. Charge is conserved

Whenever two bodies are charged by rubbing, one gets positively charged and the other, negatively charged. The net charge on the two bodies, however, remains zeroâ€”the same as that before rubbing. In other words, charge is conserved. It can neither be created nor destroyed. The only thing that happens on rubbing is that charged particles (electrons) get transferred from one body to the other.

In some phenomena, charged particles are created. But even then, the conservation of charge holds. For example, a free neutron converts itself into an electron and a proton. A neutron has no charge on it. The net charge on the electron and the proton taken together is also zero. So, there is no change in the net charge in the conversion of a neutron to an electron and a proton.

## Example-1

Which is bigger, a coulomb or the charge of an electron? How many electronic charges form one coulomb of charge?

### Solution

The charge of an electron is $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$, which is an extremely small quantity. A coulomb (1 C) is a much larger unit of charge.

To find the number of electronic charges in one coulomb, we use the quantization of charge formula $Q = ne$, where $Q = 1 \text{ C}$ and $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

Number of electronic charges in one coulomb, $n = \frac{q}{e} = \frac{1 \text{ coulomb}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ coulomb}}$

Solution continues from the previous section:

$$n = \frac{1}{1.6 \times 10^{-19}} = 0.625 \times 10^{19} = 6.25 \times 10^{18}$$

Clearly, 1 coulomb of charge is bigger than the charge of an electron.

## Example-2

A copper sphere of mass 2.0 g contains about $2 \times 10^{22}$ atoms. The charge on the nucleus of each atom is $29e$. What fraction of the electrons must be removed from the sphere to give it a charge of $+2 \mu \text{C}$?

### Solution

First, let's find the total number of electrons in the sphere. Each atom has a nucleus with a charge of $29e$, meaning it has 29 protons and, in a neutral atom, 29 electrons.

Total number of electrons = (Number of atoms) $\times$ (Electrons per atom)
Total number of electrons = $(2 \times 10^{22}) \times 29 = 58 \times 10^{22} = 5.8 \times 10^{23}$ electrons.

Next, we need to determine how many electrons must be removed to achieve a charge of $+2 \mu \text{C}$.
The charge to be achieved is $Q = +2 \mu \text{C} = +2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}$.
The charge of a single electron is $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

Number of electrons to be removed ($n_{\text{removed}}$) = $\frac{\text{Desired charge}}{\text{Charge of one electron}}$
$n_{\text{removed}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-6} \text{ C}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C/electron}} = 1.25 \times 10^{13}$ electrons.

Finally, we calculate the fraction of electrons that must be removed:
Fraction removed = $\frac{\text{Electrons removed}}{\text{Total number of electrons}}$
Fraction removed = $\frac{1.25 \times 10^{13}}{5.8 \times 10^{23}}$

Fraction removed $\approx 0.2155 \times 10^{-10} \approx 2.16 \times 10^{-11}$.

So, approximately $2.16 \times 10^{-11}$ of the total electrons must be removed.

## Example-3

How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water? Assume that the mass of water in the cup is 250 g.

## Example-3

How much positive and negative charge is there in a cup of water? Assume that the mass of water in the cup is 250 g.

### Solution

First, we determine the molecular mass of water ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).
Molecular mass of water = (2 $\times$ Atomic mass of Hydrogen) + (1 $\times$ Atomic mass of Oxygen)
Molecular mass of water $\approx (2 \times 1 \text{ g/mol}) + (1 \times 16 \text{ g/mol}) = 18 \text{ g/mol}$.

Next, we calculate the number of water molecules in 250 g of water. We use Avogadro's number ($N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \text{ molecules/mol}$).

Number of moles of water = $\frac{\text{Mass of water}}{\text{Molecular mass of water}} = \frac{250 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g/mol}}$.
Number of molecules in one cup of water = $\left(\frac{250}{18}\right) \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}$ molecules.

Now, let's consider the charge in a single water molecule ($\text{H}_2\text{O}$).
Each hydrogen atom has 1 proton and 1 electron.
Each oxygen atom has 8 protons and 8 electrons.

So, one water molecule contains:
Total protons = (2 from H) + (8 from O) = 10 protons.
Total electrons = (2 from H) + (8 from O) = 10 electrons.

Since each proton has a charge of $+e$ and each electron has a charge of $-e$, a neutral water molecule has a total positive charge of $10e$ and a total negative charge of $-10e$. The net charge is zero.

The total positive charge and total negative charge in the cup of water will have the same magnitude. We can calculate this magnitude:

Total charge = (Number of molecules) $\times$ (Number of protons/electrons per molecule) $\times$ (Charge of one proton/electron)
Total charge = $\left(\frac{250}{18} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}\right) \times 10 \times (1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})$

Let's calculate the value:
Total charge $= \frac{250}{18} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 10 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
Total charge $= 13.888... \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \times 16 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$
Total charge $= (13.888... \times 6.022 \times 16) \times (10^{23} \times 10^{-19}) \text{ C}$
Total charge $\approx 1340.44 \times 10^4 \text{ C}$
Total charge $\approx 1.34044 \times 10^3 \times 10^4 \text{ C}$
Total charge $\approx 1.34 \times 10^7 \text{ C}$

Therefore, a cup of water (250 g) contains approximately $1.34 \times 10^7 \text{ C}$ of positive charge and $1.34 \times 10^7 \text{ C}$ of negative charge.

# Methods of Charging

A body can be charged by friction, induction, or conduction.

## 1. Friction

In friction, when two bodies are rubbed together, electrons are transferred from one body to the other. As a result, one body becomes positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged.

**Examples:**

(i) When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod becomes positively charged while the silk becomes negatively charged. The decrease in the mass of the glass rod is equal to the total mass of electrons lost by it.  
(ii) Ebonite on rubbing with wool becomes negatively charged, making the wool positively charged.  
(iii) Clouds also get charged by friction.  
(iv) A comb moving through dry hair gets electrically charged. It starts attracting small bits of paper.  
(v) During landing or take-off, the tires of an aircraft get electrified; therefore, special material is used to manufacture them.  

Here's the information formatted in Markdown:


## 2. Induction

If a charged body is brought near a neutral body, the charged body will attract opposite charge and repel similar charge present in the neutral body. As a result of this, one side of the neutral body becomes positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. This process is called **Electrostatic Induction**.

## 3. Conduction

If a charged body is brought near a neutral body (or even another charged body) and they are connected using a conducting wire, charge will flow from the body having more charge to the neutral body or to the charged body having lower charge. This method of charging a body is known as **Charging by Conduction**.

## Detection of Charge

Charge can be detected and measured with the help of a **gold leaf electroscope**.

In the case of a gold-leaf electroscope:

1.  If a charged body is brought near an uncharged electroscope, the charge on the disc of the electroscope will be opposite to that of the body, while on the leaves, it will be similar to that of the body, and the leaves will diverge.
2.  If an uncharged electroscope is touched by a charged body, both the disc and the leaves acquire charge similar to that of the body, and the leaves will diverge.

| Charge | Mass |
| :--- | :--- |
| (1) Electric charge can be positive, negative or zero. | (1) Mass of a body is a positive quantity. |
| (2) Charge carried by a body does not depend upon velocity of the body. | (2) Mass of a body increases with its velocity as $m=\frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-v^2 / c^2}}$ where c is velocity of light in vacuum, $m$ is the mass of the body moving with velocity v and $m_0$ is rest mass of the body. |
| (3) Charge is quantized. | (3) The quantization of mass is yet to be established. |
| (4) Electric charge is always conserved. | (4) Mass is not conserved as it can be changed into energy and vice-versa. |
| (5) Force between charges can be attractive or repulsive, accordingly as charges are unlike or like charges. | (5) The gravitational force between two masses is always attractive. |

## Force between Charges

You know that charges with the same sign (like charges) repel each other, and charges with opposite signs (unlike charges) attract each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between two small particles carrying charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$, is given by **Coulomb's Law**.

Opposites can attract even when held some distance apart.

### Coulomb's Law:

The force between two small charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

In mathematical form, this law can be expressed as:

$$F=k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$

Here, $k$ is a constant and is equal to $9.0 \times 10^9 \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{~m}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2$.

Newton's third law is also true for forces acting between charged particles. Thus, the forces exerted by the charged particles on each other are equal in magnitude, but opposite in direction. The equation above gives the magnitude of this force. To determine the direction of the force acting on each, we have to consider the nature of the charges.

* For unlike charges, the force is attractive (Figure a - *not provided in text*).
* For like charges, the force is repulsive (Figure b, c - *not provided in text*).

In fact, the sign of $F$ given by the equation can be used to identify the nature, and thus, the direction of the force acting on each charged particle. If both charges have the same sign, $F$ is positive, and if they have opposite signs, $F$ is negative. Thus, positive $F$ indicates repulsion and negative $F$, attraction.
