### **Answer Key**

1.  **(4)**
    * **Explanation:** **Catenation** is the specific term for the ability of an element, especially carbon, to form strong bonds with its own atoms, creating long chains or rings.

2.  **(3)**
    * **Explanation:** Diamond, Graphite, and Fullerene are all famous allotropes (different structural forms) of the element carbon. **Cumene** is a specific organic compound (isopropylbenzene, $\mathrm{C}_9\mathrm{H}_{12}$), not an allotrope of pure carbon.

3.  **(4)**
    * **Explanation:** Pencil "lead" is a misnomer; it contains no elemental lead. It is made from a mixture of **Graphite** (the soft carbon allotrope that leaves a mark) and a clay binder.

4.  **(2)**
    * **Explanation:** Buckminsterfullerene, also known as a "buckyball," is a molecule composed of **Sixty** carbon atoms ($\mathrm{C}_{60}$) arranged in a soccer-ball shape.

5.  **(2)**
    * **Explanation:** **Carbon** is the element. "In pencils I write" refers to graphite. "In jewellery I'm fine" and "hard as a rock" refer to diamond. "Soft as a stroke" is graphite again.

6.  **(3)**
    * **Explanation:** The riddle describes the key properties of a **Covalent Compound**. "Atoms like to share" refers to covalent bonding. "No ions," "don't conduct electricity," and "bonds so tight" are all classic characteristics of covalent compounds.
