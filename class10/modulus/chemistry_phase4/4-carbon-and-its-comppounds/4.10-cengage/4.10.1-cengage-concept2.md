### **Answer**

The correct option is **(2)**.

**Explanation:**

* **(A) $\mathrm{C}_3 \mathrm{H}_4$:** This is a hydrocarbon, so it is an **(ii) Organic compound**. It fits the alkyne formula ($\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n-2}$), and with 3 carbons, it is **(iii) Propyne**. So, **A $\rightarrow$ (ii), (iii)**.
* **(B) $\mathrm{C}_3 \mathrm{H}_6$:** This is a hydrocarbon, so it is an **(ii) Organic compound**. It fits the alkene/cycloalkane formula ($\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n}$). **(iv) Cyclopropane** is a 3-carbon cycloalkane with this formula. So, **B $\rightarrow$ (ii), (iv)**.
* **(C) Alum:** Alum is an inorganic salt (e.g., potassium aluminum sulfate). It is an **(i) Inorganic compound**. So, **C $\rightarrow$ (i)**.
* **(D) Alcohol:** Alcohols (e.g., ethanol $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_5\mathrm{OH}$) are a class of carbon-based compounds, making them **(ii) Organic compound**. So, **D $\rightarrow$ (ii)**.

### **Answer Key**

1.  **(3)**
    * **Explanation:** Unsaturated compounds have the general formula $\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n}$ (alkenes) or $\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n-2}$ (alkynes).
    * $\mathrm{C}_4\mathrm{H}_6$ fits $\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n-2}$ (an alkyne, unsaturated).
    * $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}$ fits $\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n}$ (an alkene, unsaturated).
    * All other pairs contain at least one saturated alkane ($\mathrm{C}_n\mathrm{H}_{2n+2}$), such as $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6$, $\mathrm{C}_5\mathrm{H}_{12}$, or $\mathrm{C}_4\mathrm{H}_{10}$.

2.  **(3)**
    * **Explanation:** $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_6$ is benzene, a cyclic (ring) molecule famous for its alternating single and double bonds. $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}$ (cyclohexane) only has single bonds. $\mathrm{C}_5\mathrm{H}_{10}$ (cyclopentane) only has single bonds. $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{14}$ (hexane) is not cyclic.

3.  **(2)**
    * **Explanation:** Ethane ($\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_6$) has the structure $\mathrm{CH_3}-\mathrm{CH_3}$. Each of the two carbon atoms is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, for a total of $3 + 3 = 6$ $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

4.  **(1)**
    * **Explanation:** $\mathrm{CHCl}_3$ (chloroform) is a covalent molecule, as all its atoms (C, H, Cl) are non-metals and share electrons. The other compounds are ionic: $\mathrm{CaCO}_3$ contains $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_3^{2-}$ ions; $\mathrm{NaHCO}_3$ contains $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}$ ions; $\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{C}$ is an ionic carbide.

5.  **(2)**
    * **Explanation:** Carbon (Period 2) has 4 valence electrons. By forming four covalent bonds, it shares 4 more electrons, completing its octet (8 valence electrons). This stable 8-electron configuration is the same as the noble gas at the end of its period, which is Neon (Ne).

6.  **(2)**
    * **Explanation:**
        * Propane ($\mathrm{C}_3\mathrm{H}_8$) has **8** hydrogens.
        * Propyne ($\mathrm{C}_3\mathrm{H}_4$) has **4** hydrogens.
        * Propene ($\mathrm{C}_3\mathrm{H}_6$) has **6** hydrogens.
        * Difference (Propane - Propyne) = $8 - 4 = 4$.
        * Difference (Propane - Propene) = $8 - 6 = 2$.
        * The ratio of these differences is $4:2$, which simplifies to $2:1$.

7.  **(3)**
    * **Explanation:** The riddle's clues "hydrocarbon with a double bond," "less saturated," "more reactive," and "plastic" all point to the **Alkenes** family. (e.g., ethene is used to make polyethylene).
