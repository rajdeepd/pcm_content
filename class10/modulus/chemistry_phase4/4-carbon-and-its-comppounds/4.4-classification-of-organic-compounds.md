## CLASSIFICATIONS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

Organic compounds are classified into two major groups:
1.  **Aliphatic**
2.  **Aromatic**





---

### 1. Aliphatic Compounds

The term 'aliphatic' comes from the Greek word *aliphos*, meaning fat. Fats were the first compounds of this type to be studied.

These compounds may be:
* **Open-chain** (acyclic)
  
* **Closed-chain** (cyclic)

The aliphatic cyclic compounds are also called **alicyclic** (aliphatic + cyclic) compounds.

#### Open-chain or Acyclic Compounds

The compounds contain **straight or branched chains** of carbon atoms. Some common examples of open-chain compounds are as follows.

Sometimes an atom of an element other than carbon can also occur in the chain.

#### Closed-chain or cyclic compounds

These compounds contain rings of atoms.

### 2. Aromatic Compounds

It was found that several organic compounds, containing rings with alternate single and double bonds, had a characteristic **aroma** (a pleasing smell). Such compounds have properties different from those of aliphatic compounds, and are known as **aromatic compounds**. However, it was found later that all compounds of this class do not have a pleasing smell.

The aromatic compounds may be further subdivided into two types:
* Homocyclic
* Heterocyclic

---

#### Homocyclic Aromatic Compounds
These compounds contain at least one **benzene ($\mathrm{C}_6 \mathrm{H}_6$) ring**. A benzene ring is an especially stable ring of six carbon atoms with alternate single and double bonds between them.

The following are two examples of homocyclic aromatic compounds.

**Benzene**

**Phenol**

#### Heterocyclic Aromatic Compounds
They contain an atom other than C in the ring system.

**Pyridine**
(a nitrogen heterocyclic compound)
