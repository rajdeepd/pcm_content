# Sequence

A succession of terms $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, \ldots$ formed according to some rule or law.
Examples are: $1,4,9,16,25$

$$
\begin{gathered}
-1,1,-1,1, \ldots \\
\frac{x}{1!}, \frac{x^2}{2!}, \frac{x^3}{3!}, \frac{x^4}{4!}, \ldots
\end{gathered}
$$


A finite sequence has a finite (i.e., limited) number of terms, as in the first example above. An infinite sequence has an unlimited number of terms, i.e., there is no last term, as in the second and third examples.

Series
The indicated sum of the terms of a sequence. In the case of a finite sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n$ the corresponding series is:

$$
a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots+a_n=\sum_{k=1}^n a_k
$$


This series has a finite or limited number of terms and is called a finite series.

Arithmetic Progression (A.P.)
A.P. is a sequence whose terms differ by a fixed number. This fixed number is called the common difference. If $a$ is the first term and $d$ the common difference, then A.P. can be written as

$$
a, a+d, a+2 d, \ldots, a+(n-1) d, \ldots
$$

(a) $n^{\text {th }}$ term of $\operatorname{AP} T_n=a+(n-1) d$, where $d=t_n-t_{n-1}$
(b) The sum of the first terms:
