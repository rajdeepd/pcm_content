# Geometric Progression (G.P.)

G.P. is a sequence of non-zero numbers each of the succeeding term is equal to the preceding term multiplied by a constant. Thus, in a G.P. the ratio of successive terms is constant. This constant factor is called the COMMON RATIO of the sequence and is obtained by dividing any term by the immediately previous term. Therefore, $a, a r, a r^2, a r^3, a r^4, \ldots$ is a G.P. with ' $a$ ' as the first term and ' $r$ ' as common ratio.   

(a) $n^{\text {th }}$ term; $T_n=a r^{n-1}$.  
(b) Sum of the first $n$ terms; $S_n=\frac{a\left(r^n-1\right)}{r-1}$, if $r \neq 1$.  
(c) Sum of infinite G.P., $S_{\infty}=\frac{a}{1-r} ; 0<|r|<1$

## Properties of G.P.

## 📘 Properties of a Geometric Progression (G.P.)

(a) If each term of a G.P. is **multiplied or divided** by the same non-zero quantity,  
then the resulting sequence is also a **G.P.**

---

(b) **Three consecutive terms of a G.P.:**  
$ \dfrac{a}{r},\ a,\ a r $

**Four consecutive terms of a G.P.:**  
$ \dfrac{a}{r^3},\ \dfrac{a}{r},\ a r,\ a r^3 $  
and so on.

---

(c) If $a, b, c$ are in G.P., then  
$ b^2 = a c $

---

(d) If in a G.P., the product of two terms which are **equidistant** from the first and last term is constant and equal to the product of the first and last term, then  

$$
T_k \cdot T_{n - k + 1} = \text{constant} = a \times l
$$

---

(e) If each term of a G.P. is **raised to the same power**,  
then the resulting sequence is also a **G.P.**

---

(f) In a G.P.,  
$ T_r^2 = T_{r - k} \cdot T_{r + k} $,  
where $k < r$, and $r \neq 1$

---

(g) If the terms of a given G.P. are **chosen at regular intervals**,  
then the new sequence is also a **G.P.**

---

(h) If $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n$ is a G.P. of **positive terms**,  
then $ \log a_1, \log a_2, \ldots, \log a_n $ is an **A.P.**, and vice-versa.

---

(i) If $a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots$ and $b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots$ are two G.P.s,  
then the sequences  

$ a_1 b_1, a_2 b_2, a_3 b_3, \ldots $  
and  
$ \dfrac{a_1}{b_1}, \dfrac{a_2}{b_2}, \dfrac{a_3}{b_3}, \ldots $  

are also **G.P.s**

(j) $ \displaystyle \cdots \left( \frac{\pi}{n} \right)^{k - 1} \cdot (a \times n) $
