# C1 Arithmetic Progression (A.P)

A sequence of terms $t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_n, \ldots$ are said to be in A.P if $t_{k+1}-t_k=$ constant $\forall k \in \mathbb{N}$.

The first term '$t_1$' in an A.P is usually denoted by **'$a$'** and the constant difference between two successive terms by **'$d$'**, called the **common difference** of the A.P. Therefore the A.P is of the form $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, \ldots$.

### $\boldsymbol{n}^{\text {th }}$ term of an A.P

The nth term of an A.P denoted by '$t_n$' is given by

$$
t_n=a+(n-1) d
$$

> **Note:** Since '$a$' and '$d$' are constants and $t_n=a+(n-1) d$, the nth term of an A.P is a linear expression in '$n$'.

### Sum of the first $n$ terms of an AP is given by

We can also write this as

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbf{S}=\frac{\boldsymbol{n}}{\mathbf{2}}[\mathbf{2} \boldsymbol{a}+(\boldsymbol{n}-\mathbf{1}) \boldsymbol{d}] \\
& \mathrm{S}=\frac{n}{2}[a+a+(n-1) d] \\
& \mathbf{S}=\frac{\boldsymbol{n}}{\mathbf{2}}\left(a+\boldsymbol{a}_n\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


Now, if there are only $n$ terms in an AP, then $a_n=1$, the last term. From (3), we see that

$$
\mathrm{S}=\frac{n}{2}(a+1)
$$
