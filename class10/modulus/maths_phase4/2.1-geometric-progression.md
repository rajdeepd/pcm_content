# C5. Geometric Progression (G.P)

A sequence of terms $t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_n, \ldots$ are said to be in G.P if $\frac{t_{k+1}}{t_k} = \text{constant } \forall k \in \mathbb{N}$.

The first term '$t_1$' is denoted by **'$a$'** and the constant ratio between two successive terms by **'$r$'**, called the **common ratio**.

Then a G.P is of the form $a, ar, ar^2, \ldots$

> **Note:** All the terms in the G.P are non-zero.

## nth term of a G.P

The '$n$'th term of a G.P denoted by '$t_n$' is given by
$$t_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}$$

---

## Sum of '$n$' terms of a G.P

The sum of '$n$' terms of G.P denoted by $S_n$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-1} \\
& S_n = \begin{cases} na, & \text{if } r=1 \\ a\left(\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}\right), & \text{if } r \neq 1 \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

If $-1 < r < 1$ then $r^n$ tends to zero for infinite value of $n$.

$\therefore$ In this case the sum of infinite terms denoted by $S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}$, where $-1 < r < 1$.
