## C7. Geometric Means (GM's)

Let '$a$' and '$b$' be two quantities. If $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are '$n$' quantities such that $a, x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n, b$ are in G.P, then $x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n$ are called '$n$' **G.M's** between '$a$' and '$b$'.

Now, $b$ is the $(n+2)^{\text{th}}$ term:
$$b = t_{n+2} = a \cdot r^{n+1}$$
$$\Rightarrow \text{Common ratio } r = \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{\frac{1}{n+1}}$$

### Product of '$n$' GM's between $a$ & $b$
$$x_1 x_2 x_3 \ldots x_n = (a b)^{\frac{n}{2}}$$

## Practice Problems

1.  If one GM '$G$' and two AM's '$p$' and '$q$' are inserted between two given numbers, then show that $G^2=(2 p-q)(2 q-p)$

### Solution


## C8. Harmonic Progression (H.P)

A sequence of terms $t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots, t_n$ are said to be in H.P if $\frac{1}{t_1}, \frac{1}{t_2}, \frac{1}{t_3}, \ldots, \frac{1}{t_n}$ are in A.P.

Therefore an Harmonic progression is of the form $\frac{1}{a}, \frac{1}{a+d}, \frac{1}{a+2d}, \ldots$

### $n^{\text{th}}$ term of H.P

The $n^{\text{th}}$ term of an H.P denoted by $t_n$ is given by
$$t_n=\frac{1}{a+(n-1) d}$$
