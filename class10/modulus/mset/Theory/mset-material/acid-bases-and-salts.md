# 🧪 **ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS — Detailed Summary**

---

## 🌍 **Introduction**

Acids, bases, and salts are among the most fundamental substances in chemistry and play a vital role in our daily life as well as in industrial processes.

- **Acids** are substances that produce hydrogen ions ($H^+$) in aqueous solution.
- **Bases** are substances that produce hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) or accept protons.
- **Salts** are compounds formed when acids react with bases through *neutralisation*, giving ionic compounds composed of positive and negative ions.

In nature and industry, these substances are found everywhere — from the acid in our stomach ($HCl$) to baking soda ($NaHCO_3$), from soaps (basic salts) to fertilizers (neutral salts).

## ⚛️ **Theories of Acids and Bases**

Chemists have proposed several theories to explain the behavior of acids and bases.

---

### 🧫 **1. Arrhenius Theory (1884)**

**Statement:**  
An *acid* is a substance that dissociates in water to produce $H^+$ ions, while a *base* dissociates to produce $OH^-$ ions.

**Examples:**

$HCl_{(aq)} → H^+ + Cl^-$  
$NaOH_{(aq)} → Na^+ + OH^-$

**Neutralisation:**

$H^+ + OH^- → H_2O$

**Key Points:**
- Requires aqueous medium.
- Explains electrical conductivity of acids and bases.
- Introduces the idea of ionic dissociation.

**Limitations:**
- Fails to explain basic character of substances like NH₃ (no OH⁻ present).  
- Does not apply to non-aqueous systems (e.g., gas-phase reactions).  
- Cannot describe acid–base reactions without hydrogen.

### ⚛️ **2. Brønsted–Lowry Theory (1923)**

**Concept:**

An **acid** is a *proton donor* and a **base** is a *proton acceptor*.

**Examples:**

$HCl + H_2O → H_3O^+ + Cl^-$  
→ Here $HCl$ donates a proton (acid) and $H_2O$ accepts it (base).

$NH_3 + H_2O → NH_4^+ + OH^-$  
→ $NH_3$ acts as a base (proton acceptor).

**Conjugate Acid–Base Pairs:**

$HCl / Cl^-$ and $NH_4^+ / NH_3$

Each acid–base reaction involves *two conjugate pairs* that differ by one proton.

**Advantages:**
- Explains acid–base reactions in non-aqueous solvents.
- Covers molecules like NH₃, CO₂, and organic acids.

**Limitations:**
- Cannot explain acid–base reactions that do not involve proton transfer (e.g., $BF_3 + NH_3$).

---

### 🔬 **3. Lewis Theory (1930)**

**Concept:**  
A **Lewis acid** is an *electron pair acceptor*; a **Lewis base** is an *electron pair donor.*

**Example:**

$BF_3 + NH_3 → BF_3 \leftarrow NH_3$

- $BF_3$ (acid) accepts the lone pair from $NH_3$ (base).  
- The arrow represents the coordinate bond formed.

**Advantages:**
- Most general theory — includes all acid–base reactions (ionic and covalent).  
- Explains the formation of complex ions and organic adducts.

**Limitations:**
- Does not quantify acid or base strength.  
- Sometimes overlaps with redox behavior.

### 🧩 **Comparison of Acid–Base Theories**

| Theory | Acid Definition | Base Definition | Example Reaction |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Arrhenius** | Gives $H^+$ in water | Gives $OH^-$ in water | $HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H_2O$ |
| **Brønsted–Lowry** | Proton donor | Proton acceptor | $NH_3 + H_2O → NH_4^+ + OH^-$ |
| **Lewis** | Electron pair acceptor | Electron pair donor | $BF_3 + NH_3 → BF_3 \leftarrow NH_3$ |

### ⚙️ **Acid and Base Strength**

- **Strong acids/bases:** Completely ionize in solution (e.g., HCl, NaOH).  
- **Weak acids/bases:** Partially ionize (e.g., CH₃COOH, NH₄OH).  
- The degree of ionisation ($\alpha$) depends on temperature, concentration, and dielectric constant of the solvent.

**Ionisation Constant:**

For acid: $K_a = \dfrac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$  
For base: $K_b = \dfrac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$

Relationship:

$K_a \times K_b = K_w = 10^{-14}$ (at 25°C)

### 🔋 **pH and Ionisation**

The strength of acids and bases is conveniently expressed in terms of pH.


$pH = -\log[H^+]$  
$pOH = -\log[OH^-]$  
At 25°C → $pH + pOH = 14$

| Nature | $[H^+]$ (mol/L) | pH |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Strong Acid | $10^{-1}$ | 1 |
| Neutral | $10^{-7}$ | 7 |
| Strong Base | $10^{-13}$ | 13 |

**Note:** pH is a logarithmic scale — each unit represents a tenfold change in $[H^+]$ concentration.
