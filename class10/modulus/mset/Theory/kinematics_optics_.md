KINEMATICS AND OPTICS

Scalar:
All those physical quantities which can be explained only by a number with suitable units are known as scalar quantities. For example length, mass, time etc. which obey the algebraic law of addition.
Vector:
All those physical quantities which need direction too, besides the numerical value and units for their complete specification are known as vector quantities. For example displacement, velocity, force, which obey vector law of addition.

Distance and displacement
Distance:
Distance moved by a particle is the total length along the path travelled by it. Distance is a scalar quantity.
Displacement:
Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial point and final point. Displacement is a vector quantity and it is directed from initial point to final point. The given figure explains the distance and displacement.

A particle moves from point O to A then A to B and then B to C . During its motion distance travelled by the particle is ( $\mathrm{OA}+\mathrm{AB}+\mathrm{BC}$ ), whereas the displacement of the particle is OC , along the direction O to C .

Speed
Speed is defined as the distance covered by a body in a unit time interval

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Speed }(\mathrm{v})=\frac{\text { Dist ance travelled }(\mathrm{S})}{\text { Time interval }(\mathrm{t})} \\
& \mathrm{v}=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

C.G.S unit of speed is $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ and MKS unit is $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$.

Uniform speed:
A body is said to move with uniform speed, it travels equal distance in equal intervals of time, however small the time interval may be.
Velocity:
The velocity of a body is defined as displacement per unit time.
If the displacement is $\vec{s}$ in a time interval of $t$ seconds then

$$
\text { Velocity }(\mathrm{v})=\frac{\text { displacement }}{\text { time }}=\frac{\overrightarrow{\mathrm{s}}}{\mathrm{t}}
$$

Velocity is a vector quantity or simply a vector. Its unit in C.G.S. system is $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ and in M.K.S. system is $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$.

Uniform Velocity:
A body is said to move with uniform velocity if it covers equal displacements in equal intervals of time however small the time interval may be. It is a vector quantity.
Acceleration
When the velocity of a body is changing, the body is said to be accelerating. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with time. It is a vector quantity.

$$
\text { Acceleration }(\mathrm{a})=\frac{\text { velocity }(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}})}{\text { time }}
$$


Units:
For C.G.S. system the unit of acceleration is $\frac{\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}}{\mathrm{sec}}=\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}^2$
For M.K.S. system the unit of acceleration is $\frac{\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}}{\mathrm{sec}}=\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}^2$
If velocity is increasing at a particular time, then the acceleration is positive. If velocity is decreasing at a particular time then the acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration is also known as retardation.
Kinematics is a branch of physics, where the motion of objects is studied without involving the terms related to the cause of motion, i.e., force
In this chapter one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration is discussed. As an example of this, motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force of attraction of earth is discussed. The equations of motion are valid when the acceleration is constant. The equations relate initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration (constant), displacement of a body and time.
Equations of Motion
$1^{\text {st }}$ Equation:
To find the velocity of a body moving with a uniform acceleration, after any given interval of time
We use the following symbols:

| Initial velocity | " u " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Time | " t " s |
| Final velocity | " v " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ |
| Uniform acceleration | " a " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ 2 |
| And distance traveled | " S " m |


Now consider a body (particle) moving with uniform acceleration $a$, starting with a velocity of $u$ in a straight line.

The initial velocity is $u$
The velocity at the end of one second is $\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{a}$

The velocity at the end of two seconds is $u+2 a$
The velocity at the end of three seconds is $\mathrm{u}+3 \mathrm{a}$
The velocity at the end of ' $t$ ' seconds is $u+t$ a
$\therefore$ The final velocity $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at

$$
\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}
$$

$2^{\text {nd }}$ Equation:
Consider a body moving with uniform acceleration in a straight line.
Let the initial velocity be $u \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
Final velocity be $\mathrm{v} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$
Acceleration be a $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
Time be $t$ seconds
And the distance traveled be S m
For uniformly accelerated motion, the displacement is average velocity x time, where the average velocity $\mathrm{V}_{\text {average }}$ is the mean of the initial velocity and final velocity,

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\text {average }}=\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}}{2}
$$

(Only for uniformly accelerated motion)
The distance traveled S in time t is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& S=V_{\text {average }} \times \text { time } \\
& S=\frac{u+v}{2} \times t
\end{aligned}
$$


We know from the first equation that $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at
Substituting $\mathrm{u}+$ at for v

$$
\text { we get } \begin{aligned}
\quad \mathrm{S} & =\left(\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}}{2}\right) \mathrm{t} \\
\mathrm{~S} & =\left(\frac{2 \mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}}{2}\right) \mathrm{t} \\
\mathrm{~S} & =\frac{2 \mathrm{ut}}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{at}^2}{2} \\
\therefore \mathrm{~S} & =\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \\
\mathrm{~S} & =\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \ldots \ldots \ldots . .(\text { II })
\end{aligned}
$$

$3^{\text {rd }}$ Equation:
This is usually used to find the acceleration, displacement or velocity when time ' $t$ ' is not given.
(Relation between $\mathrm{u}, \mathrm{v}, \mathrm{a}$ and S )

We know that $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at and
We have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}=\mathrm{at} \ldots \ldots(1) \text { and } \\
& \mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}=\frac{2 \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{t}} \ldots \ldots(2) \quad\left(\text { As average velocity }=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{t}}=\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$


Multiplying (1)and (2)we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& (\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) \times(\mathrm{v}+\mathrm{u})=(\mathrm{at}) \times \frac{2 \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{t}} \\
& \mathrm{v}^2-\mathrm{u}^2=2 \mathrm{as} \\
& \mathrm{v}^2-\mathrm{u}^2=2 \mathrm{as} \\
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{as}
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus velocity ' $v$ ', acquired by a body in traveling a distance. ' $S$ ', can be found out from this equation.
Corollary to $2^{\text {nd }}$ equation:
Distance traveled by a body in $t^{\text {th }}$ second of its motion.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \\
& \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{t}-1}=\mathrm{u}(\mathrm{t}-1)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(\mathrm{t}-1)^2
\end{aligned}
$$


Equation (1)-(2)

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}-1} & =\left[\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2\right]-\left[\mathrm{u}(\mathrm{t}-1)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(\mathrm{t}-1)^2\right] \\
& =\left[\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2\right]-\left[\mathrm{ut}-\mathrm{u} \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(-2 \mathrm{t})\right]=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}-\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a} \\
& =\mathrm{u}+\frac{\mathrm{a}}{2}[2 \mathrm{t}-1] \quad
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { where } \mathrm{u} \text { is the initial velocity and } \\
& \mathrm{a} \text { is the uniform acceleration. }
\end{aligned}
$$


Motion under Gravity
If a body is thrown up vertically against gravity or is falling under gravity, then the equations of motion can be modified and acceleration can be replaced by acceleration due to gravity.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u} \pm \mathrm{gt} \\
& \mathrm{~h}=\mathrm{ut} \pm \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{gt}^2 \\
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2 \pm 2 \mathrm{gh}
\end{aligned}
$$


Note: The acceleration due to gravity ' $g$ ' is always direct towards the centre of the earth. If a body falls under gravity its velocity goes on increasing till it collides with the earth If a body is thrown vertically upwards it will be retarded and would finally come to rest momentarily after which it will again start falling back.

OPTICS
Geometrical Optics
In geometrical optics we analyze the formation of images by assuming the light to travel in a straight line path or rays. For this reason geometrical optics is also known as ray optics.

A ray of light gives the direction of propagation of light. When light meets a surface, which separates the two media, reflection and refraction take place. An image or an array of images may be formed due to this.

Beam of light
A beam of light is a bunch of light rays. It may be convergent, divergent or parallel.
1. A convergent beam is that in which the rays are directed towards a point.
2. A divergent beam is that in which the light rays are directed away from a point.
3. In a parallel beam of light all the rays are parallel to each other.

Object and image
The point of intersection of the incident rays is called object and the point of intersection of the corresponding reflected / refracted rays is called image.
Reflection
Reflection takes place when rays of light return to the same medium after striking the surface of another medium. The wavelength and the velocity of the light wave remains the same.

Laws of reflection are obeyed at every reflecting surface, i.e.
1. Angle of incidence $=$ Angle of reflection, $\angle \mathrm{i}=\angle \mathrm{r}$
2. The incident ray, reflected ray and normal - all lie in one plane.

Reflection at plane surface
The following diagram illustrates the formation of image of a point object by a plane mirror.
$\mathrm{I}_1$ and $\mathrm{I}_2$ are the two incident rays while $\mathrm{R}_1$ and $\mathrm{R}_2$ are the corresponding reflected rays. It is clear that rays $R_1$ and $R_2$ would not intersect in front of the mirror. However, for an observer in front of the mirror, reflected rays appear to be coming from point I and thus I is the virtual image of the real object $O$.

Using simple geometry, it can be shown that, object distance = image distance; where distances are measured from the mirror.

Paraxial approximation
In all the lenses and mirrors, an approximation is made that the aperture of the mirror/lens is small compared to its radius of curvature. Thus most of the incident rays are nearly parallel to the principal axis.

Refraction at a Plane Surface
When a light ray passes from one medium to another such that it undergoes a change in velocity, refraction takes place. Hence wavelength of light changes, but frequency remains the same. For non-normal rays, the refracted ray bends towards the normal on entering an optically denser medium from a rarer one.
The deviation is, $D=|i-r|$.

Laws of refraction
1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the surface separating the two media - all lie in one plane.
2. Snell's law : For any two media the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a light beam of a particular frequency, i.e. monochromatic ray.

$$
\Rightarrow \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mathrm{c}_1}{\mathrm{c}_2}=\frac{\text { Velocity of light in medium } 1}{\text { Velocity of light in medium } 2}
$$


Refractive Index, ${ }_1 \mu_2$, by definition is,

$$
{ }_{\text {medium } 1} \mu_{\text {medium } 2}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{c_1}{c_2}
$$


When merely $\mu$ of a medium is given, it implies with respect to vacuum / air.

$$
\mu_{\text {medium }}=\frac{c_{\text {vaccum }}}{c_{\text {medium }}} \Rightarrow{ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{c_{\text {vaccum }} / c_2}{c_{\text {vaccum }} / c_1}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}
$$


As $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}$, when there are several media we can say,

$$
\frac{\sin i_1}{\sin i_2}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \Rightarrow \mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2
$$


Hence, $\mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2=\mu_3 \sin i_3=$ constant
or $\quad \mu \sin i=$ constant.
This equation is found to be very useful for solving problems involving a variable refractive index.
