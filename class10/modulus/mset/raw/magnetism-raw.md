Magnetic Effects of Electric Current
You know that an electric current in a conductor sets up a magnetic field around it. Various rules have been developed to find the direction of this magnetic field. You have learnt about the Oersted's experiment. It gives dependence of the direction of magnetic field on the direction of electric current. Ampere's swimming rule, and Ampere's right hand rule and Maxwell's cork-screw rule -- all help you to find the direction of magnetic field around the current carrying conductor.
1. Maxwell's Cork-Screw Rule

It states that if the direction of rotation of the head of the right handed screw indicates the direction of magnetic lines of force, then the direction in which its tip advances gives the direction of flow of current in a straight current carrying conductor. Generally if right handed screws are rotated clockwise, their tip moves into the plane.
if the screw is rotated clockwise then its tip advances rightwards as shown
2. Ampere's Right Hand Rule

Imagine that a current carrying conductor is held by your right hand such that the thumb points along the direction of current as shown in figure. Then the direction in which the fingers are curled around the wire represents the direction of the magnetic field around the conductor.

In figure the magnetic lines are circular and clock-wise. The direction of magnetic induction B at any point on the circle will be along the tangent
drawn at that point. How do you find the magnitude of the magnetic induction $B$ ?
3. Magnetic Induction B at a Point near a Straight Current Carrying Conductor

Consider a straight conductor carrying a current of magnitude ' $i$ ' in the direction as shown in figure. The resulting magnetic lines of force around it will be concentric circles with conductor as the center.

The magnetic induction B at a point near a straight current carrying conductor is directly proportional to the strength of the current I and inversely proportional to its distance $r$ from it and is given by

$$
\mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{r}} \text { where } \mu_0 \text { is a constant called the permeability of the free space. }
$$

4. Magnetic field at the centre of a circular current carrying coil

Magnetic field at the centre of a circular current carrying coil of radius $r$ carrying a current $i$ is given by

$$
\mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_0 \mathrm{ni}}{2 \mathrm{r}} \text { where } \mathrm{n} \text { is the number of turns of the coil. }
$$

5. Force acting on a Current Carrying Conductor placed in a Magnetic Field

A current carrying conductor is placed in a strong external magnetic field, experiences force acting on it. The magnetic force results in the deflection or motion of the conductor. Let a conductor of length $\ell$ be placed in a magnetic field of strength B so that the plane of the conductor is perpendicular to the direction of B . Now if current i passes through the conductor, a magnetic force F acting on the conductor, is given by

$$
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{i} \ell \mathrm{~B} \sin \theta
$$


Where $\theta$ is the angle between conductor and magnetic field.

$\mathrm{F}_{\min }=0$ when $\theta=0$ ( ie when the conductor is parallel to the field)
$\mathrm{F}_{\text {max }}=\mathrm{B} \mathrm{i} \ell$ when $\theta=90^{\circ}$ (ie when the conductor is perpendicular to the field)
What is the direction of magnetic force? The direction of F is given by Fleming's left hand rule.
6. Fleming's Left Hand Rule

If fore-finger, central finger and thumb of left hand such that the three fingers are mutually perpendicular, then, if the direction in which fore-finger is stretched indicates the direction of magnetic field $B$ and the
direction in which central-finger is stretched indicates the direction of flow of current then the direction in which
the thumb is stretched gives the direction of the force (called magnetic force) acting on it. Hence the conductor moves or tends to move in the direction of thumb.
7. Force acting on a charge moving in an a uniform magnetic field

Let us consider a charge $q$ moving in a field of intensity $B$ with a uniform speed $v$ then the force acting on the charge is given by
$\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{q} \mathrm{v} \mathrm{B} \sin \theta$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the direction of motion and the field.
$\mathrm{F}_{\text {min }}=0$ when $\theta=0$ ( ie when the charge is moving parallel to the field)
$\mathrm{F}_{\max }=\mathrm{q} \vee \mathrm{B}$ when $\theta=90^{\circ}$ ( i.e when the charge is moving perpendicular to the field)
Note:- The direction of this force also is given by Fleming's left hand rule and it is always perpendicular to the plane containing velocity and magnetic field directions.

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: Two magnetic poles, one of which is three times as strong as the other exert on each other a force equal to 150 mg wt., when placed 5 cm apart in air. Find the strength of the stronger pole ( $g=9.8 \mathrm{~ms}^{-2}$ )
Solution: Let the pole strength of one pole be $m$ Then the pole strength of the other is 3 m

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & F=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \times \frac{m_1 m_2}{d^2} \\
& 150 \times 10^{-6} \times 9.8=\frac{10^{-7} \times 3 \mathrm{~m}^2}{\left(5 \times 10^{-2}\right)^2} \\
\therefore & m=3.5 \mathrm{Am}
\end{array}
$$


The strength of stronger pole $=3 \mathrm{~m}=10.5 \mathrm{~A} \mathrm{~m}$.

Example 2: The magnetic moment of a short magnet is $8 \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}^2$. What is the magnetic induction at a point 20 cm away on its equatorial line from its mid point.

Solution: $\quad B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \times \frac{M}{d^3}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{B}=\frac{10^{-7} \times 8}{\left(20 \times 10^{-2}\right)^3} \\
& =10^{-4} \mathrm{~T}
\end{aligned}
$$


Example 3: Calculate the value of magnetic induction at a distance 0.5 m on the axial line of a short bar-magnet of length 5 cm and pole strength $2 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}$.
Solution: Given that $2 \ell=5 \mathrm{~cm}=0.05 \mathrm{~m}$; $\mathrm{m}=2 \times 10^{-3}$ ampere-meter and $\mathrm{d}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$. magnetic moment $\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{m} 2 \ell=2 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.05=1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}^2$
$\therefore \quad$ the magnetic induction $B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{2 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{d}^3}=10^{-7} \times \frac{2 \times 10^{-4}}{(0.5)^3}=1.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^2$.

Example 4: A magnet is 10 cm long and its pole strength is 120 CGS units ( 1 CGS unit of pole strength $=0.1 \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}$. Find the magnitude of the magnetic field B at a point on its axis at a distance 20 cm from it.

Solution: The pole strength is $\mathrm{m}=120$ CGS units $=12 \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}$. Magnetic length is $21=10 \mathrm{~cm}$ or 1 $=0.0 .05 \mathrm{~m}$. Distance fro the magnet is $\mathrm{d}=20 \mathrm{~cm}=0.2 \mathrm{~m}$. The field B at a point in end-on position is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}{4_\pi} \frac{2 \mathrm{Md}}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2-\ell^2\right)^2} \\
& =\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}{4_\pi} \frac{4 \mathrm{mld}}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2-\ell^2\right)^2} \\
& =\left(10^{-7} \frac{\mathrm{~T}-\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{~A}}\right) \frac{4 \times(12 \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}) \times(0.05 \mathrm{~m}) \times(0.2 \mathrm{~m})}{\left[(0.2 \mathrm{~m})^2-(0.05 \mathrm{~m})^2\right]^2} \\
& =3.4 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~T} .
\end{aligned}
$$


Example 5: Calculate the magnetic induction at a distance 0.5 m from the centre of a short bar-magnet on the equatorial line of a bar-magnet of length 5 cm and pole strength $2 \times 10^{-3}$ ampere-meter.

Solution: Given that $2 \ell=5 \mathrm{~cm}=0.05 \mathrm{~m}$;

$$
\mathrm{m}=2 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m} ; \mathrm{d}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}
$$


The magnetic moment $\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{m} \times 2 \ell=2 \times 10^{-3} \times 0.05=1 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}^2$.
$\therefore \quad$ the magnetic induction $B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{d}^3}=10^{-7} \times \frac{10^{-4}}{(0.5)^3}=8.0 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{~Wb} / \mathrm{m}^2$.

Solution: The magnetic induction B at a point near a straight current carrying conductor is given by $\mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_0}{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{r}}$

The magnetic fields produced by them at the mid points are in opposite in direction hence these magnetic fields get added vectorially.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& B_{\text {net }}=\vec{B}_1+\left(-\vec{B}_2\right)=\vec{B}_1 \vec{B}_2 \\
& =\frac{\mu_0}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{i_1}{r_1}-\frac{i_2}{r_2}\right)=\frac{4 \pi \times 10^{-7}}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{8}{10 \times 10^{-2}}-\frac{4}{10 \times 10^{-2}}\right) \\
& =2 \times 10^{-7} \frac{8}{10 \times 10^{-2}}=16 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~T}

& E_2=1.51 \mathrm{eV}
\end{aligned}
$$
