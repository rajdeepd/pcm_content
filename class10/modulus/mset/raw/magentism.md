MAGNETISM
The ability of a pole of a magnet to attract or repel another magnetic pole is called its pole strength. It is a scalar. Its SI unit is A m (ampere meter).

A single magnetic pole never exists in nature. If at all there exists discussion on a single pole it is only an ideal case which is considered to make the concept lucid.

Inverse Square Law of Magnetism
Consider two different bar-magnets of pole strengths $m_1$ and $m_2$. When these poles are separated by a distance $r$, as shown in Figure the force $(F)$ of attraction or repulsion between them depends on
(i) their poles strength $\mathrm{m}_1$ and $\mathrm{m}_2$
(ii) distance of separation (r) and
(iii) the medium in which hey exist.

It was coulomb who gave the relation between $\mathrm{m}_1, \mathrm{~m}_2, \mathrm{r}$ and F in the form of a law called "Inverse Square Law of Magnetism". The law assumes hypothetical isolated magnetic poles.

The inverse square law of magnetism states that the force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is directly proportional to the product of their pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them and acts along the line joining the poles.

Thus, according to this law

$$
\begin{array}{ll} 
& \mathrm{F} \propto \mathrm{~m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2 \\
\text { and } & \mathrm{F} \propto \frac{1}{\mathrm{r}^2} \\
\text { or } & \mathrm{F}=\mathrm{k} \frac{\mathrm{~m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{\mathrm{r}^2}
\end{array}
$$

where k is the constant of proportionality and it depends on the magnetic properties of the medium surrounding the magnetic poles. The value of k also depends on the system of units used for the pole strength ' $m$ '. [Strictly speaking, the inverse square law of magnetism is hypothetical because isolated poles do not exist in nature. We still study it because it offers several advantages in understanding concepts of magnetism. It is of some practical utility]. The equation (i) can be written as

$$
\mathrm{F}=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \times \frac{\mathrm{m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{\mathrm{~d}^2}
$$


Magnetic Permeability ( $\mu$ ) of a medium is defined as its ability to allow the magnetic lines of force to pass through it or to allow itself to be influenced by magnetic field.

Unit Pole Strength
Using the value of $\mu_0$ we have

$$
\mathrm{F}=10^{-7} \frac{\mathrm{~m}_1 \mathrm{~m}_2}{\mathrm{r}^2}
$$

From this formula, we define unit magnetic pole strength.
If $\mathrm{m}_1=\mathrm{m}_2=1 \mathrm{~A} \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{r}=1 \mathrm{~m}$ then $\mathrm{F}=10^{-7} \mathrm{~N}$.
The unit magnetic pole is defined as that pole which repels an identical pole at 1 metre distance with a force of $10^{-7} \mathrm{~N}$.

Magnetic Induction or Magnetic Flux Density (B)
A magnet sets up a magnetic field in the medium around it. It is easy to imagine this magnetic field as constituted by magnetic lines of force. The total number of magnetic lines of force in given area is called magnetic flux, $\phi$. This is measured in units of Weber (Wb). If a magnetic substance exists as a medium in this field, the magnetic lines readily pass through the substance because of its permeability. Then the lines are called magnetic induction lines. As a result, the substance behaves like a magnet. Since this magnetism is induced in the substance by external field, the process is called 'magnetic induction'. Then every point in the medium has a physical property called 'magnetic induction' or 'magnetic field induction' or 'magnetic flux density' denoted by $B$.

Magnetic field induction or magnetic flux density $B$ is defined as the magnetic flux passing through a unit normal area.

If $A$ is the area through which a flux $\phi(\mathrm{Wb})$ passes normally, $B$ is given by

$$
\mathrm{B}=\frac{\phi}{\mathrm{A}}
$$


This magnetic flux density $B$ at a point can be shown to be equal to the force acting on a unit north pole.

The magnetic induction B due to a magnet at a point in a medium therefore can be defined with respect to a unit north pole by convention and is measured with the help of the inverse square law. For a unit north pole $\mathrm{m}_1=1 \mathrm{~A}-\mathrm{m}$. Then in equation (i), if $\mathrm{m}_2=\mathrm{m}$, the pole strength of any magnet, we have

$$
\mathrm{F}=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{r}^2}
$$


The magnetic field induction B due to a magnet at a point in a medium is defined as the force acting on a unit north pole placed at the point.

For free space, $\quad B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\mathrm{r}^2}$
If a pole of strength m is placed at a point where the magnetic induction is B , the force acting on it is given by,

$$
\mathrm{F}=\mathrm{mB} \quad \text { or } \quad \mathrm{B}=\frac{\mathrm{F}}{\mathrm{~m}}
$$


Thus, the units of B are newton / ampere metre ( $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{A} \mathrm{m}$ ). Since $\phi$ is measured in Weber ( Wb ) the units of B are also given as $\mathrm{Wb} \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ called Tesla. 1 tesla $=10^4$ gauss, where gauss is a C.G.S unit of intensity of magnetic field.

MAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A BAR MAGNET
At a point on the axial line (end on position)
A position on the magnetic axis of a bar magnet is called an end-on position. Suppose SN is a bar magnet of magnetic length and pole strength m .

Let P be a point in end-on position at a distance d from the centre of the magnet. The magnetic field at P due to the north pole is

$$
\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{N}}=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{(\mathrm{~d}-\ell)^2}
$$

directed away from the magnet. The field due to the south pole is

$$
\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{(\mathrm{~d}+\ell)^2}
$$

direction towards the magnet. The resultant field is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& B_S=B_N-B_S \\
& \frac{\mu_o}{4 \pi}\left[\frac{1}{(d-\ell)^2}-\frac{m}{(d+\ell)^2}\right]=\frac{\mu_o}{4 \pi} \frac{2 M}{\left(d^2-\ell^2\right)^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $M=2 \ell \mathrm{~m}$ is the magnetic moment of the magnet. If $\mathrm{d} \gg \ell$, the magnet may be called a magnetic dipole and the field at an end-on position is

$$
\mathrm{B}=\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{o}}}{4 \pi} \frac{2 \mathrm{M}}{\mathrm{~d}^3}
$$


At a point on the equatorial line (Broadside-on Position)

A position on a perpendicular bisector of the bar magnet is called broadside-on position. Let P be a point in the broadside-on position of the bar magnet at a distance d from its centre. The pole strength of the magnet is m and its magnetic length SN is $2 \ell$. The field at P due to the north pole my be written as

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{N}}} \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m} \overrightarrow{\mathrm{NP}}}{\mathrm{NP}^3} .
$$

This gives the magnitude as well as the direction of the field due to the north pole. The field due to the south pole is

$$
\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{S}}} \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m} \overrightarrow{\mathrm{PS}}}{\mathrm{PS}^3} .
$$


Now, $N P=P S=\left(d^2+l^2\right)^{1 / 2}$ so that the resultant field at $P$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}}=\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{N}}}+\overrightarrow{\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{S}}} \\
& =\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m}}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2+\ell^2\right)^{3 / 2}}(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{NP}}+\overrightarrow{\mathrm{PS}}) \\
& =\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm{~m} \overrightarrow{\mathrm{NS}}}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2+\ell^2\right)^{3 / 2}}
\end{aligned}
$$


The magnetic of the field is $B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{2 l}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2+\ell^2\right)^{3 / 2}}=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{M}{\left(\mathrm{~d}^2+\ell^2\right)^{3 / 2}}$
where $\mathrm{M}=2 \ell \mathrm{~m}$ is the magnetic moment of the magnet. The direction of the field is parallel to the axis, from the north pole to the south pole.

If $\mathrm{d} \gg \ell$, the magnet may be called a magnetic dipole and the magnetic field at a point in broadside-on position is $B=\frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \frac{M}{d^3}$

Mapping of Magnetic Lines of Force due to a Bar Magnet: Neutral Points
A point where the magnetic field induction (B) due to a bar-magnet is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the horizontal component of earth's magnetic field induction ( $\mathrm{B}_0$ ) is called a neutral point.

A point at which the magnetic field induction ( $\mathrm{B}_0$ ) due to a bar-magnet is nullified by the horizontal component of earth's magnetic filed induction is called a neutral point for the bar-magnet.

Location of Neutral Points
The neutral-points of a bar magnet can be collated by mapping magnetic lines of force using a compass.

(A) N pole of a bar-magnet facing N -pole of the earth

When N -pole of a bar-magnet points towards geographical N -pole of the earth, the two neutral points lie on the equatorial line of the bar-magnet such that they are equidistant form the centre of the magnet and the neutral point distance is given by $\mathrm{d}^3 =\frac{\mathrm{M}}{390}$

(B) S pole of bar-magnet facing N -pole of the earth.

When S-pole of bar-magnet points towards the geographical N -pole of the earth, the two neutral points lie on the axial line of the bar-magnet such that they are equidistant from the centre of the magnet and the neutral point distance is given by $\mathrm{d}^3=\frac{\mathrm{M}}{195}$
