1. Hydrogen energy levels

In a hydrogen atom (or hydrogen-like ion such as He‚Å∫, Li¬≤‚Å∫, etc.),
the single electron moves around the nucleus in fixed energy levels or orbits.

Each orbit is labeled by a principal quantum number, $n = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶$

$n = 1$ ‚Üí Ground state (lowest energy)

$n = 2, 3, 4, ‚Ä¶$ ‚Üí Excited states

The farther the electron is from the nucleus, the higher its energy, but the energy is still negative because the electron is bound to the nucleus.

2. Bohr Model

Niels Bohr proposed that:

The electron can revolve only in certain stable orbits without radiating energy.

Each orbit corresponds to a quantized (fixed) energy.

Radiation (light or photon) is emitted or absorbed only when the electron jumps between two energy levels.

When an electron jumps from a higher level ($n_2$) to a lower level ($n_1$),
a photon of energy equal to the energy difference is emitted:

$
E_{\text{photon}} = E_{n_2} - E_{n_1}
$

If the electron absorbs a photon of exactly this energy, it moves to a higher orbit.

üìò Formula: Energy of an electron in the $n^{\text{th}}$ orbit

$
E_n = -\dfrac{13.6}{n^2}\ \text{eV}
$

Where:

$E_n$ = energy of the electron in the $n^{\text{th}}$ orbit

$13.6\ \text{eV}$ = ionization energy of hydrogen (energy required to remove the electron from the $n=1$ level to infinity)

The negative sign shows that the electron is bound to the nucleus.

More negative = more tightly bound

At infinity ($n = ‚àû$), $E = 0$ (electron is free)

üí° Key Points:
Orbit ($n$)	Energy (eV)	State
1	-13.6	Ground
2	-3.4	1st excited
3	-1.51	2nd excited
4	-0.85	3rd excited
‚àû	0	Ionized
üß© Energy difference between two levels

When an electron jumps between two levels ($n_1 < n_2$):

$
\Delta E = E_{n_2} - E_{n_1} = 13.6\left(\dfrac{1}{n_1^2} - \dfrac{1}{n_2^2}\right)\ \text{eV}
$

This energy corresponds to the photon absorbed or emitted:

$
E_{\text{photon}} = h\nu = \Delta E
$

‚úÖ Summary:

$E_n = -13.6/n^2$ eV ‚Üí gives total energy of an electron in orbit $n$.

The energy difference between two orbits determines the wavelength or frequency of the emitted/absorbed photon.

Negative energy means the electron is still bound to the nucleus ‚Äî the closer it is, the stronger the binding.
