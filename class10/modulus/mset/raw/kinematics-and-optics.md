KINEMATICS AND OPTICS

Scalar:
All those physical quantities which can be explained only by a number with suitable units are known as scalar quantities. For example length, mass, time etc. which obey the algebraic law of addition.
Vector:
All those physical quantities which need direction too, besides the numerical value and units for their complete specification are known as vector quantities. For example displacement, velocity, force, which obey vector law of addition.

Distance and displacement
Distance:
Distance moved by a particle is the total length along the path travelled by it. Distance is a scalar quantity.
Displacement:
Displacement is the shortest distance between the initial point and final point. Displacement is a vector quantity and it is directed from initial point to final point. The given figure explains the distance and displacement.

A particle moves from point O to A then A to B and then B to C . During its motion distance travelled by the particle is ( $\mathrm{OA}+\mathrm{AB}+\mathrm{BC}$ ), whereas the displacement of the particle is OC , along the direction O to C .

Speed
Speed is defined as the distance covered by a body in a unit time interval

$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Speed }(\mathrm{v})=\frac{\text { Dist ance travelled }(\mathrm{S})}{\text { Time interval }(\mathrm{t})} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{t}}
\end{aligned}
$

C.G.S unit of speed is $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ and MKS unit is $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$.

Uniform speed:
A body is said to move with uniform speed, it travels equal distance in equal intervals of time, however small the time interval may be.
Velocity:
The velocity of a body is defined as displacement per unit time.
If the displacement is $\vec{s}$ in a time interval of $t$ seconds then

$
\text { Velocity }(\mathrm{v})=\frac{\text { displacement }}{\text { time }}=\frac{\overrightarrow{\mathrm{s}}}{\mathrm{t}}
$

Velocity is a vector quantity or simply a vector. Its unit in C.G.S. system is $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}$ and in M.K.S. system is $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}$.

Uniform Velocity:
A body is said to move with uniform velocity if it covers equal displacements in equal intervals of time however small the time interval may be. It is a vector quantity.
Acceleration
When the velocity of a body is changing, the body is said to be accelerating. Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with time. It is a vector quantity.

$
\text { Acceleration }(\mathrm{a})=\frac{\text { velocity }(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{v}})}{\text { time }}
$


Units:
For C.G.S. system the unit of acceleration is $\frac{\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}}{\mathrm{sec}}=\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{sec}^2$
For M.K.S. system the unit of acceleration is $\frac{\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}}{\mathrm{sec}}=\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}^2$
If velocity is increasing at a particular time, then the acceleration is positive. If velocity is decreasing at a particular time then the acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration is also known as retardation.
Kinematics is a branch of physics, where the motion of objects is studied without involving the terms related to the cause of motion, i.e., force
In this chapter one-dimensional motion with constant acceleration is discussed. As an example of this, motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force of attraction of earth is discussed. The equations of motion are valid when the acceleration is constant. The equations relate initial velocity, final velocity, acceleration (constant), displacement of a body and time.
Equations of Motion
$1^{\text {st }}$ Equation:
To find the velocity of a body moving with a uniform acceleration, after any given interval of time
We use the following symbols:

| Initial velocity | " u " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ |
| :--- | :--- |
| Time | " t " s |
| Final velocity | " v " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ |
| Uniform acceleration | " a " $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$ 2 |
| And distance traveled | " S " m |


Now consider a body (particle) moving with uniform acceleration $a$, starting with a velocity of $u$ in a straight line.

The initial velocity is $u$
The velocity at the end of one second is $\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{a}$

The velocity at the end of two seconds is $u+2 a$
The velocity at the end of three seconds is $\mathrm{u}+3 \mathrm{a}$
The velocity at the end of ' $t$ ' seconds is $u+t$ a
$\therefore$ The final velocity $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at

$
\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}
$

$2^{\text {nd }}$ Equation:
Consider a body moving with uniform acceleration in a straight line.
Let the initial velocity be $u \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$
Final velocity be $\mathrm{v} \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}$
Acceleration be a $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
Time be $t$ seconds
And the distance traveled be S m
For uniformly accelerated motion, the displacement is average velocity x time, where the average velocity $\mathrm{V}_{\text {average }}$ is the mean of the initial velocity and final velocity,

$
\mathrm{V}_{\text {average }}=\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}}{2}
$

(Only for uniformly accelerated motion)
The distance traveled S in time t is given by

$
\begin{aligned}
& S=V_{\text {average }} \times \text { time } \newline
& S=\frac{u+v}{2} \times t
\end{aligned}
$


We know from the first equation that $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at
Substituting $\mathrm{u}+$ at for v

$
\text { we get } \begin{aligned}
\quad \mathrm{S} & =\left(\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}}{2}\right) \mathrm{t} \newline
\mathrm{~S} & =\left(\frac{2 \mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}}{2}\right) \mathrm{t} \newline
\mathrm{~S} & =\frac{2 \mathrm{ut}}{2}+\frac{\mathrm{at}^2}{2} \newline
\therefore \mathrm{~S} & =\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \newline
\mathrm{~S} & =\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \ldots \ldots \ldots . .(\text { II })
\end{aligned}
$

$3^{\text {rd }}$ Equation:
This is usually used to find the acceleration, displacement or velocity when time ' $t$ ' is not given.
(Relation between $\mathrm{u}, \mathrm{v}, \mathrm{a}$ and S )

We know that $\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+$ at and
We have

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}=\mathrm{at} \ldots \ldots(1) \text { and } \newline
& \mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}=\frac{2 \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{t}} \ldots \ldots(2) \quad\left(\text { As average velocity }=\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{t}}=\frac{\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{v}}{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$


Multiplying (1)and (2)we have

$
\begin{aligned}
& (\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{u}) \times(\mathrm{v}+\mathrm{u})=(\mathrm{at}) \times \frac{2 \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{t}} \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2-\mathrm{u}^2=2 \mathrm{as} \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2-\mathrm{u}^2=2 \mathrm{as} \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{as}
\end{aligned}
$


Thus velocity ' $v$ ', acquired by a body in traveling a distance. ' $S$ ', can be found out from this equation.
Corollary to $2^{\text {nd }}$ equation:
Distance traveled by a body in $t^{\text {th }}$ second of its motion.

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}}=\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{t}-1}=\mathrm{u}(\mathrm{t}-1)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(\mathrm{t}-1)^2
\end{aligned}
$


Equation (1)-(2)

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}}-\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{t}-1} & =\left[\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2\right]-\left[\mathrm{u}(\mathrm{t}-1)+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(\mathrm{t}-1)^2\right] \newline
& =\left[\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2\right]-\left[\mathrm{ut}-\mathrm{u} \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a}(-2 \mathrm{t})\right]=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at}-\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{a} \newline
& =\mathrm{u}+\frac{\mathrm{a}}{2}[2 \mathrm{t}-1] \quad
\end{aligned} \quad \begin{aligned}
& \text { where } \mathrm{u} \text { is the initial velocity and } \newline
& \mathrm{a} \text { is the uniform acceleration. }
\end{aligned}
$


Motion under Gravity
If a body is thrown up vertically against gravity or is falling under gravity, then the equations of motion can be modified and acceleration can be replaced by acceleration due to gravity.

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u} \pm \mathrm{gt} \newline
& \mathrm{~h}=\mathrm{ut} \pm \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{gt}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2 \pm 2 \mathrm{gh}
\end{aligned}
$


Note: The acceleration due to gravity ' $g$ ' is always direct towards the centre of the earth. If a body falls under gravity its velocity goes on increasing till it collides with the earth If a body is thrown vertically upwards it will be retarded and would finally come to rest momentarily after which it will again start falling back.

OPTICS
Geometrical Optics
In geometrical optics we analyze the formation of images by assuming the light to travel in a straight line path or rays. For this reason geometrical optics is also known as ray optics.

A ray of light gives the direction of propagation of light. When light meets a surface, which separates the two media, reflection and refraction take place. An image or an array of images may be formed due to this.

Beam of light
A beam of light is a bunch of light rays. It may be convergent, divergent or parallel.
1. A convergent beam is that in which the rays are directed towards a point.
2. A divergent beam is that in which the light rays are directed away from a point.
3. In a parallel beam of light all the rays are parallel to each other.

Object and image
The point of intersection of the incident rays is called object and the point of intersection of the corresponding reflected / refracted rays is called image.
Reflection
Reflection takes place when rays of light return to the same medium after striking the surface of another medium. The wavelength and the velocity of the light wave remains the same.

Laws of reflection are obeyed at every reflecting surface, i.e.
1. Angle of incidence $=$ Angle of reflection, $\angle \mathrm{i}=\angle \mathrm{r}$
2. The incident ray, reflected ray and normal - all lie in one plane.

Reflection at plane surface
The following diagram illustrates the formation of image of a point object by a plane mirror.
$\mathrm{I}_1$ and $\mathrm{I}_2$ are the two incident rays while $\mathrm{R}_1$ and $\mathrm{R}_2$ are the corresponding reflected rays. It is clear that rays $R_1$ and $R_2$ would not intersect in front of the mirror. However, for an observer in front of the mirror, reflected rays appear to be coming from point I and thus I is the virtual image of the real object $O$.

Using simple geometry, it can be shown that, object distance = image distance; where distances are measured from the mirror.

Paraxial approximation
In all the lenses and mirrors, an approximation is made that the aperture of the mirror/lens is small compared to its radius of curvature. Thus most of the incident rays are nearly parallel to the principal axis.

Refraction at a Plane Surface
When a light ray passes from one medium to another such that it undergoes a change in velocity, refraction takes place. Hence wavelength of light changes, but frequency remains the same. For non-normal rays, the refracted ray bends towards the normal on entering an optically denser medium from a rarer one.
The deviation is, $D=|i-r|$.

Laws of refraction
1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the surface separating the two media - all lie in one plane.
2. Snell's law : For any two media the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a light beam of a particular frequency, i.e. monochromatic ray.

$
\Rightarrow \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mathrm{c}_1}{\mathrm{c}_2}=\frac{\text { Velocity of light in medium } 1}{\text { Velocity of light in medium } 2}
$


Refractive Index, ${ }_1 \mu_2$, by definition is,

$
{ }_{\text {medium } 1} \mu_{\text {medium } 2}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{c_1}{c_2}
$


When merely $\mu$ of a medium is given, it implies with respect to vacuum / air.

$
\mu_{\text {medium }}=\frac{c_{\text {vaccum }}}{c_{\text {medium }}} \Rightarrow{ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{c_{\text {vaccum }} / c_2}{c_{\text {vaccum }} / c_1}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}
$


As $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}$, when there are several media we can say,

$
\frac{\sin i_1}{\sin i_2}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \Rightarrow \mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2
$


Hence, $\mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2=\mu_3 \sin i_3=$ constant
or $\quad \mu \sin i=$ constant.
This equation is found to be very useful for solving problems involving a variable refractive index.

OPTICS
Geometrical Optics
In geometrical optics we analyze the formation of images by assuming the light to travel in a straight line path or rays. For this reason geometrical optics is also known as ray optics.

A ray of light gives the direction of propagation of light. When light meets a surface, which separates the two media, reflection and refraction take place. An image or an array of images may be formed due to this.

Beam of light
A beam of light is a bunch of light rays. It may be convergent, divergent or parallel.
1. A convergent beam is that in which the rays are directed towards a point.
2. A divergent beam is that in which the light rays are directed away from a point.
3. In a parallel beam of light all the rays are parallel to each other.

Object and image
The point of intersection of the incident rays is called object and the point of intersection of the corresponding reflected / refracted rays is called image.
Reflection
Reflection takes place when rays of light return to the same medium after striking the surface of another medium. The wavelength and the velocity of the light wave remains the same.

Laws of reflection are obeyed at every reflecting surface, i.e.
1. Angle of incidence $=$ Angle of reflection, $\angle \mathrm{i}=\angle \mathrm{r}$
2. The incident ray, reflected ray and normal - all lie in one plane.

Reflection at plane surface
The following diagram illustrates the formation of image of a point object by a plane mirror.
$\mathrm{I}_1$ and $\mathrm{I}_2$ are the two incident rays while $\mathrm{R}_1$ and $\mathrm{R}_2$ are the corresponding reflected rays. It is clear that rays $R_1$ and $R_2$ would not intersect in front of the mirror. However, for an observer in front of the mirror, reflected rays appear to be coming from point I and thus I is the virtual image of the real object $O$.

Using simple geometry, it can be shown that, object distance = image distance; where distances are measured from the mirror.

Other important points which should be remembered in this context are as follows.
- The image is laterally inverted.
- The linear magnification is unity.
* When the plane mirror is rotated through an angle $\theta$, the reflected ray turns through double the angle, i.e. $2 \theta$. (for any one ray chosen)
- When two plane mirrors are kept facing each other at an angle $\theta$ and an object is placed between them, multiple images of the object are formed as a result of successive reflection. The number of images, $n$, is given by,
If $m=\frac{360}{\theta}$ is even integer or odd integer, no. of images formed $n=(m-1)$ for all positions of the object. (if $\theta=100^{\circ}, \mathrm{m}=3.6$, number of images $=3$ )
Apparent shift of objects due to refraction
Due to bending of light at the interface of two different media, the image formation due to refraction creates an illusion of shifting of the object position.
Consider an object O in medium After refraction, the ray at the interface bends. The bent ray when it falls on our eyes, is perceived as coming from I .
For nearly normal incident rays, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ will be very small

$
\begin{aligned}
& \quad \tan \theta_1=\sin \theta_1=\frac{\mathrm{AB}}{\text { Object distance from the refracting surface }} \newline
& \text { Similarly, } \sin \theta_2=\frac{\mathrm{AB}}{\text { Image distance from the refracting surface }} \newline
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\sin \theta_1}{\sin \theta_2}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \newline
& \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\mathrm{AB}}{\mathrm{OB}} / \frac{\mathrm{AB}}{\mathrm{BI}}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \newline
& \quad \frac{\mathrm{BI}}{\mathrm{OB}}=\frac{\mathrm{Apperant} \text { depth }}{\text { Real depth }}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \newline
& \text { So, Shift = Real depth - Apparent depth = Real depth }\left(1-\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$


Case-I
If $\mu_1<\mu_2$
Shift becomes negative. Image distance > object distance. Image is farther from the refracting surface
Case-II
If $\mu_1>\mu_2$
Shift becomes positive. Image distance < object distance. Image is closer to the refracting surface
Case-III
If $\mu_2=1$ or $\mu_1=\mu$
Shift $=$ Real depth $\left(1-\frac{1}{\mu}\right)$

EXAMPLES:
Example 1: A car starts from rest and moves with uniform acceleration of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ for 3 minutes. Find the velocity acquired by the car.
Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{u} & =0, \mathrm{a}=1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2, \mathrm{t}=3 \text { minutes }=3 \times 60=180 \mathrm{~s} \newline
\mathrm{v} & =\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
& =0+1 \times 180 \newline
& =180 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 2: A bus starts moving from rest and moves with uniform acceleration. Its velocity after 10 sec is observed to be $60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$. Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration.
Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{u} & =0 \newline
\mathrm{v} & =60 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr} \newline
& =60 \times \frac{5}{18}=\frac{50}{3} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
\mathrm{v} & =\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
\frac{50}{3} & =0+\mathrm{a} \times 10 \newline
\mathrm{a} & =\frac{50 / 3}{10}=\frac{5}{3}=1.67 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2
\end{aligned}
$


Example 3: The velocity of a body is $30 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ at a particular instant. After how much time will its velocity be equal to $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ if it has a uniform acceleration of $2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$.

Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{u}=30 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=\frac{25}{3} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
& 25=\frac{25}{3}+2 \times \mathrm{t} \newline
& \Rightarrow \quad \mathrm{t}=\frac{25}{3} \text { seconds. }
\end{aligned}
$


Example 4: A bus driver observes a obstacle at a distance and presses the brakes if the bus was initially moving along a straight line with a velocity of $90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ how much time will it take for the bus to stop if the retardation due to the brakes is $6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$.
Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{u}=90 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=0, \mathrm{a}=-6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
& 0=25-6 \times \mathrm{t} \newline
& \mathrm{t}=\frac{25}{6}=4.16 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$

Example 5: The driver of a car moving at a certain speed presses the brake. After 10 seconds of pressing the brake it is observed that the speed of the body is $72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and after 20 seconds of pressing the brake it is observed that the speed of the body is $18 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$. Calculate the speed of the car (in $\mathrm{km} / \mathrm{hr}$ ) when the brakes were pressed. Also calculate the retardation due to the brakes.
Solution: Method I:
For first 10 s .

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{t}=10 \mathrm{~s} \newline
& 20=\mathrm{u}+10 \mathrm{a}
\end{aligned}
$


After 20 seconds.

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=18 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{t}=20 \mathrm{~s} . \newline
& 5=\mathrm{u}+20 \mathrm{a} \newline
& 20=\mathrm{u}+10 \mathrm{a} \newline
& 5=\mathrm{u}+20 \mathrm{a} \newline
& 15=-10 \mathrm{a}
\end{aligned}
$

therefore $a=-1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$.

$
\begin{aligned}
20 & =\mathrm{u}+10 \mathrm{a} \newline
25 & =\mathrm{u}+10(-1.5) \newline
\mathrm{u} & =20-10(-1.5) \newline
& =35 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
\mathrm{u} & =35 \times 18 / 5=126 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}
\end{aligned}
$


Method II:
For the period from 10 s to 20 s

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{u}=72 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{v}=18 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{t}=10 \mathrm{~s} . \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
& 5=20+\mathrm{a} \times 10 \newline
& 10 \mathrm{a}=-15 \newline
& \mathrm{a}=-1.5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 .
\end{aligned}
$


For first 10seconds:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{at} \newline
& 20=\mathrm{u}-1.5 \times 10 \newline
& \mathrm{u}=20+15 \newline
& \mathrm{u}=35 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& \mathrm{u}=35 \times 18 / 5=126 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 6: A body is moving with a speed of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. It has got a uniform acceleration of 2 $\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ because of which its speed goes on increasing. Find the distance covered by the body in 20s.
Solution: $\quad \mathrm{S}=\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2$

$
10 \times 20+\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 20^2=200+400=600 \mathrm{~m}
$

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{as} \newline
& 0=256-2 \times 5 \times \mathrm{s} \newline
& \mathrm{~S}=\frac{256}{10}=25.6 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


Total distance covered $=32+25.6=57.6 \mathrm{~m}$.
Example 13: The driver presses the brakes of a car which was moving with a uniform speed of $20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. As a result the vehicle slows down and finally stops. If the brakes can retard the vehicle at the rate of $10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$, then calculate the distance it will travel before coming to rest.
Solution :

$
\begin{aligned}
& u=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, v=0, a=-10 \newline
& v^2=u^2+2 a \mathrm{~s} \newline
& (0)^2=(20)^2+2(-10) \mathrm{s} \newline
& 400=20 \mathrm{~s} \newline
& s=20 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 14: The driver of a car watches a barrier at a distance of 100 m in front of him. As a reaction, he presses the brakes. If his reaction time is 2.5 s and he was moving with a uniform speed of $30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ before the application of brakes, then, find out if the driver
hits the barrier or not. The retardation of the brakes is uniform and equal to $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
Solution: Distance travelled during reaction time $2.5 \times 30=75 \mathrm{~m}$

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{u} & =30 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{v}=0, \mathrm{a}=-5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \newline
\mathrm{v}^2 & =\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{as} \newline
0 & =900-2 \times 5 \times \mathrm{S} \newline
\mathrm{~S} & =90 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


Total distance $=75+90=165 \mathrm{~m}$
Since the barrier is 100 m away, he will hit the barrier.
Example 15: A body is moving in a circular path of radius 28 m . When it reaches the diametrically opposite point B, a linesman says that the body's speed has increased by $8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. If the tangential acceleration is uniform at the rate of $1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$, calculate the velocity of the body at
point $A$ and at point $B$. What will be the speed of the body, when it again reaches point $A$.
Solution: From A to B:
Distance traveled $=\pi \mathrm{r}$. (along the circumference)

$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{22}{7} \times 28=88 \mathrm{~m} \newline
& a=1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2, \mathrm{~s}=88 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$

$
\begin{aligned}
& v^2=u^2+2 a s \newline
& (v+u)(v-u)=2 \times 1 \times 88 \newline
& (v+u) 8=176 \newline
& v+u=22 \newline
& v-u=8 \newline
& v=\frac{22+8}{2}=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& u=7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& V_B=15 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, V_A=7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \newline
& S=2 \times \frac{22}{7} \times 28=176 \newline
& v^2=u^2+2 a s \newline
& v^2=7^2+2 \times 1 \times 176 \newline
& v^2=49+352 \newline
& v=\sqrt{401}=20 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 16: A body starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at the rate of $5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$. Calculate the distance covered by it in the $6^{\text {th }}$ second of its motion.
Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{u} & =0, \mathrm{a}=5 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2, \mathrm{t}=6 \mathrm{~s} \newline
\mathrm{~S}_{6 \mathrm{th}} & =\mathrm{u}+\frac{\mathrm{a}}{2}(2 \mathrm{t}-1) \newline
& =0+\frac{5}{2} \times(2 \times 6-1) \newline
& =\frac{5}{2} \times 11=27.5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$

since the body is moving along a straight line (without reversing its direction of motion) the above calculated displacement is also the distance traveled.

$
\text { Aliter: } \begin{aligned}
\mathrm{S}_6 & =\mathrm{ut}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{at}^2 \newline
& =\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 36=90 \mathrm{~m} \newline
\mathrm{~S}_5 & =\frac{1}{2} \text { at }=\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 25=62.5 \mathrm{~m} \newline
\mathrm{~S}_6 & =\mathrm{S}_6-\mathrm{S}_5=90-62.5=27.5 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 17: A body is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of $39.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate the time taken to reach the maximum height as well as the maximum height reached by the body. (Given g $=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$ )
Solution: (take upward vectors as +ve)

$
\mathrm{u}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{v}=0 \text { (at highest point ) } \mathrm{g}=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} \text { (retardation) }
$

$\mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}-\mathrm{g} \mathrm{t}$

$
\begin{aligned}
& 0=39.2-9.8 t \newline
& t=4 \mathrm{~s} .
\end{aligned}
$


Height attained:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{v}=0, \mathrm{u}=39.2 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{~g}=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2-2 \mathrm{gS} \newline
& 0=(39.2)^2-2 \times 9.8 \times \mathrm{S} \newline
& \mathrm{~S}=\frac{39.2 \times 39.2}{2 \times 98}=78.4 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


So, after 4 second the body will be at a height of 78.4 m i.e. at maximum height.
Example 18: A body falls freely from a height of 9.8 m . Calculate the time required by the body to reach the ground $\left(g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2\right)$. Also find the velocity with which it strikes the ground.
Solution: (take downward vectors as +ve)

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{u}=0, \mathrm{~h}=9.8 \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{~g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{~h}=\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{gt}^2 \newline
& 9.8=\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times \mathrm{t}^2 \newline
& \mathrm{t}=\sqrt{2}=1.414 \text { seconds. } \newline
& \mathrm{v}^2=\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{gh} \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 9.8}= \pm 9.8 \sqrt{2}
\end{aligned}
$

here $\mathrm{v}=+9.8 \sqrt{2} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ as the direction of velocity is downwards

$
=13.86 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} .
$


Example 19: A body is projected vertically upwards with a velocity of $19.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate
(a) time of flight ( total time it was in air)
(b) velocity with which it strikes the ground again.
(c)Net displacement
(d) Net distance covered, ( $\mathrm{g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}+2$ ).

Solution:

$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{u}=19.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, \mathrm{~g}=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \mathrm{v}=0 . \newline
& \mathrm{v}=\mathrm{u}-\mathrm{gt} \newline
& 0=19.6-9.8 \times \mathrm{t}_1 \newline
& \mathrm{t}_1=2 \mathrm{~s} \newline
& \mathrm{~h}=\mathrm{ut}_1-\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{gt}_1^2 \newline
& =19.6 \times 2-\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times(2)^2 \newline
& =19.6 \mathrm{~m}
\end{aligned}
$


Time required to cover the distance while falling down.

$
\begin{aligned}
& 19.6=\frac{1}{2} \times 9.8 \times \mathrm{t}_2{ }^2 \Rightarrow \mathrm{t}_2=\sqrt{\frac{2 \times 19.6}{9.8}}=2 \mathrm{sec} \newline
& \text { total time required }=\mathrm{t}_1+\mathrm{t}_2 \newline
& =2+2=4 \mathrm{~s}
\end{aligned}
$


Note: Time of ascent = Time of descent
At highest point, $\mathrm{u}=0 \mathrm{t}_2=2 \mathrm{~s}, \mathrm{~g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{V} & =\mathrm{u}+\mathrm{gt} \newline
& =0+9.8 \times 2=19.6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$


Note: It strikes the ground with the same velocity it was projected with. As it comes to the same point the net displacement is zero.

$
\text { Distance covered }=\mathrm{h}+\mathrm{h}=2 \mathrm{~h}=2 \times 19.6=39.2 \mathrm{~m} \text {. }
$


Example 20: A body is projected so that it reaches the top of a tower of height 29.4 m . if the acceleration due to gravity is $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$, calculate the maximum velocity of projection, so that it reaches to the top of the tower.
Solution: At highest point velocity $=0, \mathrm{~h}=29.4 \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{~g}=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$

$
\begin{aligned}
& v^2=u^2+2 g h \newline
& 0=u^2-2 \times 9.8 \times 29.4 \newline
& u=\sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 29.4}=24 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 21: A body is projected vertically upward from the top of a tower of height 19.6 m with a velocity of $9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Calculate the time after which it strikes the ground. Also, calculate the velocity of body at the instant of striking the ground.
Solution: $\quad u=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}, g=-9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$
$\therefore$ time after which it comes to rest momentarily

$
\begin{aligned}
& v=u+g t \newline
& 0=9.8-9.8 t_1 \newline
& t_1=1 s . \newline
& \therefore \quad v^2=u^2+2 g h \newline
& 0=(9.8)^2-2 \times 9.8 \times h \newline
& h=\frac{9.8 \times 9.8}{2 \times 9.8}=4.9 m
\end{aligned}
$

$\therefore$ Total height above the ground $=19.6+4.9=24.5 \mathrm{~m}$.
Time required to fall from a height of 24.5 m

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{u} & =0, \mathrm{~g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2 \newline
\mathrm{~S} & =\mathrm{ut}+1 / 2 \mathrm{gt}^2 \newline
24.5 & =1 / 2 \times 9.8 \times \mathrm{t}_2^2 \newline
\mathrm{t}_2 & =\sqrt{\frac{24.5 \times 2}{9.8}}-\sqrt{5 \mathrm{~s}}
\end{aligned}
$


Total time required $=\mathrm{t}_1+\mathrm{t}_2$

$
=1 s+\sqrt{5} s
$


Again, $\mathrm{u}=0, \mathrm{~S}=24.5 \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{~g}=9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$

$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{v}^2 & =\mathrm{u}^2+2 \mathrm{gs} \newline
\mathrm{v} & =\sqrt{2 \mathrm{gs}} \newline
& =\sqrt{2 \times 9.8 \times 24.5}=21.91 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}
\end{aligned}
$


Example 22: A point source of light $B$ is placed at a distance $L$ in front of the centre of a mirror of width d hung vertically on a wall.

Example 23: Two plane mirrors are inclined to each other such that a ray of light incident on the first mirror and parallel to the second is reflected from the second mirror parallel to the first mirror. Determine the angle between the two mirrors.

Solution : Let $\theta$ be the angle between the two mirrors $\mathrm{OM}_1$ and $\mathrm{OM}_2$. The incident ray AB is parallel to mirror $\mathrm{OM}_2$ and strikes the mirror $\mathrm{OM}_1$ at an angle of incidence equal to $\alpha$. It is reflected along $B C$; the angle of reflection being $\alpha$. From figure we have

$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow \quad \mu_{\text {air }} \sin 30^{\circ}=\mu_{\text {wattar }} \sin \theta_4 \newline

Solution: Apparent depth (AD) $=\frac{t_1}{\mu_1}+\frac{t_2}{\mu_2}$

$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore \quad \frac{36}{7}=\frac{5}{5 / 3}+\frac{3}{\mu_2} \newline

A ray of light is incident at the surface $A B$ of the slab as shown. Find the maximum value of incidence angle $\alpha_{\text {max }}$, such that the ray comes out only from
the other surface ED.

Solution: For a maximum angle of incidence at surface AB there will be a minimum angle of incidence at the surface AD . A ray to pass through the surface DE at it should not pass beyond $A D$ ie. it should not refract at $A D$. Hence, the angle $\theta$ should be the critical angle. By
