# 2. COULOMB'S LAW

**Coulomb's Law:** The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

If two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are separated by a distance $r$ in medium, the magnitude of the force between them is given by:

$
F \propto q_1 q_2 \newline
$
$
F \propto \frac{1}{r^2} \newline
$
$
F=\frac{k\left|q_1 q_2\right|}{\varepsilon_r r^2} \newline
$
$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\left|q_1 q_2\right|}{r^2} \newline
$

Where $\varepsilon_0$ is called the permittivity of free space.
$
\varepsilon_0= 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}^2 \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-2} \newline
$
$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}=9 \times 10^9 \mathrm{Nm}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2 \newline
$

and Where $k$ is the constant of proportionality and has a value of $9 \times 10^9 \mathrm{Nm}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2$ (in vacuum).

$\varepsilon_r = \text{Dielectric constant of medium}$

(i) This force is directed along the line joining the two charges.

(ii) For like charges, it is repulsive (positive in sign); for unlike charges, it is attractive (negative in sign).

(iii) Coulomb's force is analogous to the gravitational force. Both forces vary inversely as the square of the distance between two particles.

### Example 1

From the given set of charges, which charge(s) is/are not possible?
(a) $0.8 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C} \newline$
(b) $3.2 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{C} \newline$

### Solution

(a) $0.8 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$

By $Q = ne$

$n$ must be integer, $n = 500$

$
\begin{aligned}
& 0.8 \times 10^{-16}=n\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \\
& n=500
\end{aligned}
$

500 is an integer; so, it is possible.

(b) $3.2 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{C}$, By $Q = ne$

$
\begin{aligned}
& 3.2 \times 10^{-20}=n\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \newline
& \therefore n=\frac{1}{5}
\end{aligned} \newline
$

$\frac{1}{5}$ is a fraction; so, it is not possible.

### Example 2

There are two charges $+1 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $+5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ separated by some distance. The ratio of the forces acting on them be.  
(1) $1: 5$
(2) $1: 1$
(3) $5: 1$
(4) $1: 25$

**Solution (2)**
Same force will act on both bodies, although their directions will be different.

### Example 3

According to Coulomb's law, which of the following is correct for the attraction?   
(1) $q_1 q_2<0$
(2) $q_1 q_2>0$
(3) $q_1 q_2=0$
(4) $q_1 q_2>100 \mathrm{C}$

**Solution (1)**
For attraction, one charge should be positive, and other should be negative.
So, their product of magnitude is negative.

### Example 4

A charge $q$ is placed at the centre of the line joining two equal charges $Q$, the system of the three charges w be in equilibrium, if $q$ is equal to  
(1) $\frac{-Q}{2}$  
(2) $\frac{-Q}{4}$  
(3) $\frac{+Q}{4}$  
(4) $\frac{+Q}{2}$  

**Solution (2)**

For equilibrium, net force on $q$, $Q$, and $Q$ should be zero.

<img src="./images/electricity-fig6.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

$
\left(F_{\mathrm{C}}\right)_{\text {net}}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{k Q Q}{(2 x)^2}+\frac{k Q q}{x^2}=0 \newline
$

$
\Rightarrow \frac{Q}{4}+q=0 \Rightarrow q=\frac{-Q}{4} \newline
$

### Example 5

Two point charges $+3 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $+8 \mu \mathrm{C}$ repel each other with a force of 40 N. If a charge of $-5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ is added to each of them, then force between them will become \_\_\_\_.

**Solution**
Redistribution of charges takes place.
Initially, $q_1=3 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and Charge $q_2=8 \mu \mathrm{C}$
$
40=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{3 \times 8}{r^2}
$
When third charge $q_3=-5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ is added to each, then new charges on $q_1$ and $q_2$ will be
$
q_1=3-5=-2 \mu \mathrm{C} \newline
$
and
$
q_2=8-5=3 \mu \mathrm{C} \newline
$
Finally, $F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{-2 \times 3}{r^2} \newline $
So, $\frac{F}{40}=\frac{-2 \times 3}{3 \times 8} \newline $ 

$\Rightarrow F=-10 \mathrm{~N}\newline$ -ve sign indicates attraction.
