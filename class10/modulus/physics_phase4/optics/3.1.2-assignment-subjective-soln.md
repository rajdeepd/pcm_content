## ASSIGNMENT PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS

### LEVEL-I

**1. A particle starting from rest and moving with a uniform acceleration, covers a distance X in the first 10 seconds. In the next 10 seconds it covers a distance of 30 metre more than what it covered in the first 10 seconds. Calculate the value of X . Also determine the velocity of the particle at the end of 30 seconds.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Initial velocity, $u = 0$ (starts from rest)
* Distance in first 10 s, $s_1 = X$
* Distance in next 10 s (from $t=10$ to $t=20$), $s_2 = X + 30$

**Formulas:**
* $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
* $v = u + at$

**Calculations:**
1.  **For the first 10 seconds ($t=10$):**
    $X = (0)(10) + \frac{1}{2}a(10)^2$
    $X = 50a$  --- (Eq. 1)

2.  **For the total 20 seconds ($t=20$):**
    Total distance $s_{total} = s_1 + s_2 = X + (X + 30) = 2X + 30$
    $s_{total} = (0)(20) + \frac{1}{2}a(20)^2$
    $2X + 30 = 200a$ --- (Eq. 2)

3.  **Solve for $a$ and $X$:**
    Substitute Eq. 1 into Eq. 2:
    $2(50a) + 30 = 200a$
    $100a + 30 = 200a$
    $100a = 30 \Rightarrow a = 0.3 \mathrm{~m/s^2}$

    Now find $X$ using Eq. 1:
    $X = 50(0.3) = 15 \mathrm{~m}$

4.  **Velocity at 30 seconds ($t=30$):**
    $v = u + at = 0 + (0.3)(30)$
    $v = 9 \mathrm{~m/s}$

**Answer:**
* The value of **$X$ is 15 m**.
* The velocity at the end of 30 seconds is **$9 \mathrm{~m/s}$**.

---

**2. A ball is projected vertically upward with a speed of $50 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. Find the speed at half the maximum height?**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Initial upward speed, $u = 50 \mathrm{~m/s}$
* Acceleration due to gravity, $a = -9.8 \mathrm{~m/s^2}$ (acting downwards)

**Formulas:**
* $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ (where $v$ is final velocity, $a$ is acceleration, $s$ is displacement)

**Calculations:**
1.  **Find Maximum Height ($H_{max}$):**
    At the maximum height, the final velocity $v = 0$.
    $0^2 = (50)^2 + 2(-9.8)H_{max}$
    $0 = 2500 - 19.6 H_{max}$
    $H_{max} = \frac{2500}{19.6} \approx 127.55 \mathrm{~m}$

2.  **Find Speed at Half Maximum Height ($s = H_{max} / 2$):**
    We need to find $v$ when $s = \frac{H_{max}}{2}$.
    $v^2 = u^2 + 2a(\frac{H_{max}}{2})$
    From step 1, we know $2aH_{max} = -u^2$, so $aH_{max} = -u^2 / 2$.
    $v^2 = u^2 + aH_{max}$
    $v^2 = u^2 + (\frac{-u^2}{2})$
    $v^2 = \frac{u^2}{2}$
    $v^2 = \frac{(50)^2}{2} = \frac{2500}{2} = 1250$
    $v = \sqrt{1250} = \sqrt{625 \times 2} = 25\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~m/s}$

**Answer:**
* The speed at half the maximum height is **$25\sqrt{2} \mathrm{~m/s}$** (approximately $35.36 \mathrm{~m/s}$).

**3. An object 2 cm high, forms an inverted image 3 cm high, when the distance between the object and images is 10 cm . By drawing a geometric diagram, calculate the nature and the focal length of lens.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Object height, $h_o = 2 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Image is inverted, so image height $h_i = -3 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Distance between object and real image, $d = v - u = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ (using sign convention where $u$ is negative and $v$ is positive).

**Analysis:**
1.  **Nature:** Since the image is **inverted**, it must be a **real** image. Only a **convex lens** can form a real image.

    

2.  **Calculations:**
    Magnification, $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5$
    Also, $m = \frac{v}{u}$.
    $\frac{v}{u} = -1.5 \Rightarrow v = -1.5u$ --- (Eq. 1)

    We are given the distance between them is 10 cm:
    $v - u = 10$ --- (Eq. 2)

    Substitute Eq. 1 into Eq. 2:
    $(-1.5u) - u = 10$
    $-2.5u = 10 \Rightarrow u = -4 \mathrm{~cm}$

    Now find $v$:
    $v = -1.5(-4) = +6 \mathrm{~cm}$

    (Check: $v - u = 6 - (-4) = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$. This is correct.)

3.  **Focal Length ($f$):**
    Using the lens formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
    $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{-4}$
    $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2 + 3}{12} = \frac{5}{12}$
    $f = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Answer:**
* **Nature:** **Convex lens**
* **Focal Length:** **$+2.4 \mathrm{~cm}$**

---

**4. A 5 cm tall object is placed on the principal axis of diverging lens of focal length 15 cm and at a distance of 10 cm from it. Find the nature, position and size of image.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Object height, $h_o = 5 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Diverging lens $\Rightarrow$ focal length is negative, $f = -15 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Object distance, $u = -10 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Formulas:**
* Lens formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
* Magnification: $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{v}{u}$

**Calculations:**
1.  **Position ($v$):**
    $\frac{1}{-15} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{-10}$
    $-\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{10}$
    $\frac{1}{v} = -\frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{-2 - 3}{30} = \frac{-5}{30} = -\frac{1}{6}$
    $v = -6 \mathrm{~cm}$

2.  **Nature:**
    * Since $v$ is negative, the image is **virtual**.
    * Since it is a diverging lens, the image is **erect** and **diminished**.
    * It is formed **6 cm from the lens on the same side as the object**.

3.  **Size ($h_i$):**
    $m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{-6}{-10} = +0.6$
    $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} \Rightarrow 0.6 = \frac{h_i}{5}$
    $h_i = 0.6 \times 5 = 3 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Answer:**
* **Nature:** **Virtual, erect, and diminished**.
* **Position:** **6 cm from the lens on the same side as the object**.
* **Size:** **3 cm tall**.

---

**5. An object 6 cm high, is placed at a distance of 36 cm from a diverging lens of focal length 12 cm . By scale diagram find the position of size of image.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Object height, $h_o = 6 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Object distance, $u = -36 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Diverging lens $\Rightarrow$ focal length $f = -12 \mathrm{~cm}$

*(Note: The problem asks for a scale diagram. The solution below is calculated algebraically to find the exact values a scale diagram would represent.)*



[Image of ray diagram for virtual image formation by diverging lens]


**Formulas:**
* Lens formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
* Magnification: $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{v}{u}$

**Calculations:**
1.  **Position ($v$):**
    $\frac{1}{-12} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{-36}$
    $-\frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{36}$
    $\frac{1}{v} = -\frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{36} = \frac{-3 - 1}{36} = \frac{-4}{36} = -\frac{1}{9}$
    $v = -9 \mathrm{~cm}$

2.  **Size ($h_i$):**
    $m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{-9}{-36} = +0.25$
    $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} \Rightarrow 0.25 = \frac{h_i}{6}$
    $h_i = 1.5 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Answer:**
* **Position:** **9 cm from the lens on the same side as the object**.
* **Size:** **1.5 cm tall**.

### LEVEL-II

**1. From the top of a tower of height h , a body is thrown vertically downwards with an initial velocity $u$ simultaneously, another body is thrown vertically upwards with an initial velocity $u$.**
**(a) Will the bodies strike the ground at the same instant?**
**(b) If not calculate the additional time require by the body thrown upwards.**
**(c) Also find the difference in velocities of the two bodies at the instant they strike the ground.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Displacement for both bodies, $s = -h$
* Body 1 (down): initial velocity $u_1 = -u$
* Body 2 (up): initial velocity $u_2 = +u$
* Acceleration for both, $a = -g$

**Formulas:**
* $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
* $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$

**Analysis:**
**(a) Will they strike at the same instant?**
**No.** Body 2 travels upward to its peak, falls back to the top of the tower (at which point its velocity will be $-u$, the same as Body 1's initial velocity), and *then* travels the height $h$. It has a longer path and will take more time.

**(b) Additional time:**
* **Time for Body 1 ($t_1$):**
    $-h = (-u)t_1 + \frac{1}{2}(-g)t_1^2 \Rightarrow gt_1^2 + 2ut_1 - 2h = 0$
    Using the quadratic formula (and taking the positive root for time):
    $t_1 = \frac{-2u + \sqrt{(2u)^2 - 4(g)(-2h)}}{2g} = \frac{-u + \sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}}{g}$

* **Time for Body 2 ($t_2$):**
    $-h = (+u)t_2 + \frac{1}{2}(-g)t_2^2 \Rightarrow gt_2^2 - 2ut_2 - 2h = 0$
    Using the quadratic formula (and taking the positive root):
    $t_2 = \frac{2u + \sqrt{(-2u)^2 - 4(g)(-2h)}}{2g} = \frac{u + \sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}}{g}$

* **Additional Time ($\Delta t = t_2 - t_1$):**
    $\Delta t = \frac{(u + \sqrt{...}) - (-u + \sqrt{...})}{g} = \frac{u - (-u)}{g} = \frac{2u}{g}$

**(c) Difference in final velocities:**
* **Velocity for Body 1 ($v_1$):**
    $v_1^2 = u_1^2 + 2as = (-u)^2 + 2(-g)(-h) = u^2 + 2gh$
    $v_1 = -\sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}$ (negative as it's moving down)

* **Velocity for Body 2 ($v_2$):**
    $v_2^2 = u_2^2 + 2as = (+u)^2 + 2(-g)(-h) = u^2 + 2gh$
    $v_2 = -\sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}$

The final velocities are identical.

**Answer:**
* **(a) No.**
* **(b) The additional time required is $\frac{2u}{g}$.**
* **(c) The difference in their final velocities is 0.**

**2. A ball is dropped from a height. If it takes 0.2 sec to cross the last 6 m before hitting the ground, find the height from which it was dropped. Take $g=10 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^2$.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Initial velocity, $u = 0$ (dropped)
* $g = 10 \mathrm{~m/s^2}$
* Last $s_{last} = 6 \mathrm{~m}$ is covered in $t_{last} = 0.2 \mathrm{~s}$

**Formulas:**
* $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
* $v^2 = u^2 + 2gs$

**Method 1 (Using $v$):**
1.  Let $v_1$ be the velocity just *before* the ball enters the last 6 m.
2.  Consider the motion *during* the last 6 m:
    $s_{last} = v_1t_{last} + \frac{1}{2}gt_{last}^2$
    $6 = v_1(0.2) + \frac{1}{2}(10)(0.2)^2$
    $6 = 0.2v_1 + 5(0.04)$
    $6 = 0.2v_1 + 0.2$
    $5.8 = 0.2v_1 \Rightarrow v_1 = 29 \mathrm{~m/s}$
3.  Now find the height $h_1$ required to fall from rest to reach this speed $v_1$:
    $v_1^2 = u^2 + 2gh_1$
    $(29)^2 = 0^2 + 2(10)h_1$
    $841 = 20h_1 \Rightarrow h_1 = 42.05 \mathrm{~m}$
4.  The total height $H$ is $h_1$ plus the last 6 m:
    $H = h_1 + s_{last} = 42.05 + 6 = 48.05 \mathrm{~m}$

**Method 2 (Using $t$):**
1.  Let $H$ be the total height and $t$ be the total time.
    $H = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 5t^2$ --- (Eq. 1)
2.  The height *before* the last 6 m is $H-6$. The time to fall this height is $t - 0.2$.
    $H - 6 = \frac{1}{2}g(t - 0.2)^2 = 5(t^2 - 0.4t + 0.04)$
    $H - 6 = 5t^2 - 2t + 0.2$ --- (Eq. 2)
3.  Substitute Eq. 1 into Eq. 2:
    $(5t^2) - 6 = (5t^2) - 2t + 0.2$
    $-6 = -2t + 0.2$
    $2t = 6.2 \Rightarrow t = 3.1 \mathrm{~s}$
4.  Find $H$ using Eq. 1:
    $H = 5(3.1)^2 = 5(9.61) = 48.05 \mathrm{~m}$

**Answer:**
* The height from which it was dropped is **$48.05 \mathrm{~m}$**.

**3. Monochromatic light of wavelength 600 nm is incident from air on a glass surface. What are the wavelength, frequency and speed of the refracted light? $\mu$ of glass is 1.5 .**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Wavelength in air, $\lambda_{air} = 600 \mathrm{~nm} = 600 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}$
* Refractive index of glass, $\mu_g = 1.5$
* Speed of light in air (vacuum), $c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}$



[Image of light ray refracting from air into glass]


**Concepts:**
1.  **Frequency ($f$) remains constant** when light changes media.
2.  $\mu = \frac{c}{v}$ (where $v$ is speed in the medium)
3.  $\mu = \frac{\lambda_{air}}{\lambda_{medium}}$

**Calculations:**
1.  **Frequency ($f$):**
    First, find the frequency in air. This frequency will be the same in glass.
    $c = f \times \lambda_{air} \Rightarrow f = \frac{c}{\lambda_{air}}$
    $f = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}}{600 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{6 \times 10^{-7}} = 0.5 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{~Hz}$
    $f = 5 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$

2.  **Speed ($v_g$):**
    $\mu_g = \frac{c}{v_g} \Rightarrow v_g = \frac{c}{\mu_g}$
    $v_g = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}}{1.5} = 2 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}$

3.  **Wavelength ($\lambda_g$):**
    $\mu_g = \frac{\lambda_{air}}{\lambda_g} \Rightarrow \lambda_g = \frac{\lambda_{air}}{\mu_g}$
    $\lambda_g = \frac{600 \mathrm{~nm}}{1.5} = 400 \mathrm{~nm}$

**Answer:**
* **Wavelength:** **$400 \mathrm{~nm}$**
* **Frequency:** **$5 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~Hz}$**
* **Speed:** **$2 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}$**

**4. The bottom of a container is 4 cm thick glass ( $\mu=1.5$ ) slab. The container contains two immiscible liquids A and B of depths 6 cm and 8 cm respectively. What is the apparent position of a scratch on outer surface of the bottom of the glass slab when viewed through the container? Refractive indices of A and B are 1.4 and 1.3 respectively.**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Observer is looking from the top, down through the liquids.
* Liquid B: $d_B = 8 \mathrm{~cm}$, $\mu_B = 1.3$ (assuming B is on top)
* Liquid A: $d_A = 6 \mathrm{~cm}$, $\mu_A = 1.4$
* Glass: $d_g = 4 \mathrm{~cm}$, $\mu_g = 1.5$

**Formula:**
The total apparent depth ($d_{app}$) is the sum of the apparent depths of each individual layer.
$d_{app} = \frac{d_{real}}{\mu}$



**Calculations:**
$d_{app, total} = d_{app, B} + d_{app, A} + d_{app, g}$
$d_{app, total} = \left(\frac{d_B}{\mu_B}\right) + \left(\frac{d_A}{\mu_A}\right) + \left(\frac{d_g}{\mu_g}\right)$
$d_{app, total} = \left(\frac{8}{1.3}\right) + \left(\frac{6}{1.4}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{1.5}\right)$
$d_{app, total} \approx 6.154 + 4.286 + 2.667$
$d_{app, total} \approx 13.107 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Answer:**
* The apparent position of the scratch is **$13.11 \mathrm{~cm}$** below the top surface of the liquids.

**5. A needle placed 45 cm from a lens forms an image on a screen placed 90 cm on other side of the lens. Identify the type of lens and determine its focal length. What is the size of the image if the needle is 5 cm ?**

#### Solution
**Given:**
* Needle (object) distance, $u = -45 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Image is on a **screen** $\Rightarrow$ **real image**.
* Image is on the **other side** $\Rightarrow$ image distance is positive, $v = +90 \mathrm{~cm}$
* Object height, $h_o = 5 \mathrm{~cm}$

**Formulas:**
* Lens formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
* Magnification: $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{v}{u}$

**Calculations:**
1.  **Identify Lens Type:**
    Only a **convex lens** can form a real image.

    

2.  **Determine Focal Length ($f$):**
    $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}$
    $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{90} - \frac{1}{-45}$
    $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{90} + \frac{2}{90} = \frac{3}{90} = \frac{1}{30}$
    $f = +30 \mathrm{~cm}$ (Positive $f$ confirms it is a convex lens)

3.  **Determine Image Size ($h_i$):**
    $m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{+90}{-45} = -2$
    $m = \frac{h_i}{h_o} \Rightarrow -2 = \frac{h_i}{5}$
    $h_i = -10 \mathrm{~cm}$
    The size is 10 cm. The negative sign indicates the image is inverted.

**Answer:**
* **Lens Type:** **Convex lens**
* **Focal Length:** **$+30 \mathrm{~cm}$**
* **Size of Image:** **10 cm** (and it is inverted)
