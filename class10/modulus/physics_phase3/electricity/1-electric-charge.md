**OVERVIEW**

The text explains that **charge** is the foundation of all electrical phenomena, measured in **Coulombs (C)**. Matter consists of protons (positive charge: $+1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$), electrons (equal negative charge: $-1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$), and neutral neutrons.

Normally, bodies are neutral with equal protons and electrons. An imbalance, created by transferring electrons (like rubbing a glass rod with silk), results in a body becoming **positively charged** (losing electrons) or **negatively charged** (gaining electrons).

These charges exert forces: **like charges repel** and **unlike charges attract**.

An **electric current** is defined as the directional flow of charged particles, such as electrons. This flow requires a **potential difference**. Examples of electricity mentioned include natural phenomena like lightning, static shocks, and the electrical signals in the heart measured by an ECG machine.


## 1. ELECTRIC CHARGE**

* **Definition:** Charge is a fundamental property of matter that causes it to produce and experience electrical and magnetic effects.
* **Two Types:**
    * **Positive Charge:** Occurs when an object has **more protons than electrons** (e.g., by losing electrons).
    * **Negative Charge:** Occurs when an object has **more electrons than protons** (e.g., by gaining electrons).



### 1.1 Properties of Electric Charge


Charged particles can be created by disturbing the neutrality of an atom. Loss of electrons gives a positive darge (since $n_p > n_e$ ) to a particle. During charging, mass of the body changes as shown below:

Charges with the same electrical sign repel each other, and charges with opposite electrical signs attract each other.

A charged body may attract a neutral body or a positively charged body, but it always repels the body having similar charges. Hence, repulsion is the surest test of electrification.

* **Quantization of charge:** If the charge of an electron ($e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$) is taken as elementary unit, i.e., quanta of charge, then charge on any body will be some integral multiple of $e$, i.e., $Q= \pm n e$, where $n=1,2$, $3, \ldots$ (natural numbers). This is because the body can acquire charge by gaining or losing electrons only.
* **Transferable:** It can be transferred from one body to another.
* **Associated with mass:** Charge cannot exist without mass; however, mass can exist without charge.
* **Conserved:** Charge can neither be created nor be destroyed (law of conservation of charge).
* **Invariant:** Charge is independent of velocity of charged particle.
* Electric charge produces electric field $(\vec{E})$, magnetic field $(\vec{B})$, and electromagnetic radiations.

**Unit and Dimensional Formula**
* The SI unit of charge $=$ ampere $\times s=$ coulomb $(\mathrm{C})$
* Smaller unit is $\mu \mathrm{C}$ (microcoulomb), $1 \mu \mathrm{C}=10^{-6} \mathrm{C}$
* The CGS unit of charge is statcoulomb or electrostatic unit (esu)
$
{ }^1 \mathrm{C}=3 \times 10^9 \text { stat coulomb }=\frac{1}{10} \mathrm{ab} \text { coulomb (absolute coulomb; } \mathrm{abC} \text { ) }
$
* Electromagnetic unit $(\mathrm{emu})$ of charge $=\mathrm{abC}$
$
{ }^1 \mathrm{abC}=10 \mathrm{C}
$

### 1.2 Point Charge

A **point charge** is an idealized model where a charged object is treated as if its entire charge is concentrated at a single point, with no physical dimensions.

This model can be used for real objects under specific conditions:

* **Large Separation:** When the distance *between* charged objects is significantly larger than their individual sizes, their dimensions become negligible, and they can be treated as point charges.
* **Symmetrical Objects:** A finite-sized body, like an **isolated charged sphere**, behaves like a point charge. Due to its uniform symmetry, it produces an electric field outside its surface that is identical to the field that would be created by a single point charge (with the same total charge) located at the sphere's center.
    * This is true both at a **very large distance** and at points **very close to its surface** (as long as they are outside the sphere).
    * This behavior is a key consequence of Gauss's Law and results in the electric field following an **inverse-square law** ($E \propto 1/r^2$), just like a point charge.

### 1.3 Charge on a Conductor

Charge given to a conductor always resides on its **outer surface**. This is why the outer radius of both a solid and a hollow conducting sphere will hold maximum equal charge.

If the surface is uniform, the charge distributes uniformly on the surface; for an irregular surface, the distribution of charge, i.e., **charge density, is not uniform**.

It is maximum where the radius of curvature is minimum and vice versa, i.e., $\sigma \propto (1/R)$. This is why charge leaks from sharp points.

### 1.4 Charge Distribution

Charge distribution can be classified as either continuous or discrete.

#### (i) Discrete distribution of charge:

A system consisting of ultimate individual charges.

#### (ii) Continuous distribution of charge:

An amount of charge distributed uniformly or non-uniformly over a body. It is of following three types.

**(a) Linear charge distribution:**
Charge distributed evenly/unevenly along a line. For example, charge on a straight wire, charged circular ring, etc. It is denoted by lambda ($\lambda$).

<img src="./images/electricity-fig3.png"/>

  * **Formula:** $\lambda = \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Length}} = \text{Linear charge density}$
  * **S.I. unit:** $\text{C/m}$

**(b) Surface charge distribution:**
Charge distributed over a surface. For example, plane sheet of charge, surface conducting sphere, outer and inner surface conducting cylinder, etc. It is denoted by sigma ($\sigma$).

<img src="./images/electricity-fig3.png"/>

  * **Formula:** $\sigma = \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Area}} = \text{Surface charge density}$
  * **S.I. unit:** $\text{C/m}^2$

**(c) Volume charge density:**
Charge distributed throughout the volume of the body. For example, charge on a dielectric sphere, etc. It is denoted by rho ($\rho$).

  * **Formula:** $\rho = \frac{\text{Charge}}{\text{Volume}} = \text{Volume charge density}$
  * **S.I. unit:** $\text{C/m}^3$

### 2. COULOMB'S LAW

**Coulomb's Law:** The force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of two charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

If two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ are separated by a distance $r$ in medium, the magnitude of the force between them is given by:

$
F \propto q_1 q_2
$
$
F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
$
$
F=\frac{k\left|q_1 q_2\right|}{\varepsilon_r r^2}
$
$
F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r} \frac{\left|q_1 q_2\right|}{r^2}
$

Where $\varepsilon_0$ is called the permittivity of free space.
$
\varepsilon_0= 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{C}^2 \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}
$
$
k=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}=9 \times 10^9 \mathrm{Nm}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2
$

and Where $k$ is the constant of proportionality and has a value of $9 \times 10^9 \mathrm{Nm}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2$ (in vacuum).

$\varepsilon_r = \text{Dielectric constant of medium}$

(i) This force is directed along the line joining the two charges.

(ii) For like charges, it is repulsive (positive in sign); for unlike charges, it is attractive (negative in sign).

(iii) Coulomb's force is analogous to the gravitational force. Both forces vary inversely as the square of the distance between two particles.

### Example 1

From the given set of charges, which charge(s) is/are not possible?
(a) $0.8 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$
(b) $3.2 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{C}$

### Solution

(a) $0.8 \times 10^{-16} \mathrm{C}$

By $Q = ne$

$n$ must be integer, $n = 500$

$
\begin{aligned}
& 0.8 \times 10^{-16}=n\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \\
& n=500
\end{aligned}
$

500 is an integer; so, it is possible.

(b) $3.2 \times 10^{-20} \mathrm{C}$, By $Q = ne$

$
\begin{aligned}
& 3.2 \times 10^{-20}=n\left(1.6 \times 10^{-19}\right) \\
& \therefore n=\frac{1}{5}
\end{aligned}
$

$\frac{1}{5}$ is a fraction; so, it is not possible.

### Example 2

There are two charges $+1 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $+5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ separated by some distance. The ratio of the forces acting on them be.  
(1) $1: 5$
(2) $1: 1$
(3) $5: 1$
(4) $1: 25$

**Solution (2)**
Same force will act on both bodies, although their directions will be different.

### Example 3

According to Coulomb's law, which of the following is correct for the attraction?   
(1) $q_1 q_2<0$
(2) $q_1 q_2>0$
(3) $q_1 q_2=0$
(4) $q_1 q_2>100 \mathrm{C}$

**Solution (1)**
For attraction, one charge should be positive, and other should be negative.
So, their product of magnitude is negative.

---

### Example 4

A charge $q$ is placed at the centre of the line joining two equal charges $Q$, the system of the three charges w be in equilibrium, if $q$ is equal to  
(1) $\frac{-Q}{2}$  
(2) $\frac{-Q}{4}$  
(3) $\frac{+Q}{4}$  
(4) $\frac{+Q}{2}$  

**Solution (2)**

For equilibrium, net force on $q$, $Q$, and $Q$ should be zero.
<div align="center">
<img src="./images/electricity-fig6.png" width="50%"/>
</div>

$
\left(F_{\mathrm{C}}\right)_{\text {net}}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{k Q Q}{(2 x)^2}+\frac{k Q q}{x^2}=0
$
$
\Rightarrow \frac{Q}{4}+q=0 \Rightarrow q=\frac{-Q}{4}
$

### Example 5

Two point charges $+3 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and $+8 \mu \mathrm{C}$ repel each other with a force of 40 N. If a charge of $-5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ is added to each of them, then force between them will become \_\_\_\_.

**Solution**
Redistribution of charges takes place.
Initially, $q_1=3 \mu \mathrm{C}$ and Charge $q_2=8 \mu \mathrm{C}$
$
40=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{3 \times 8}{r^2}
$
When third charge $q_3=-5 \mu \mathrm{C}$ is added to each, then new charges on $q_1$ and $q_2$ will be
$
q_1=3-5=-2 \mu \mathrm{C}
$
and
$
q_2=8-5=3 \mu \mathrm{C}
$
Finally, $F=\frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{-2 \times 3}{r^2}$
So, $\frac{F}{40}=\frac{-2 \times 3}{3 \times 8}$

$\Rightarrow F=-10 \mathrm{~N}$, -ve sign indicates attraction.

### 3. ELECTRIC FIELD

* **Electric field** due to a given charge is defined as the space around the charge in which electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion due to charge can be experienced by any other charge. If a test charge experiences no force at a point, the electric field at that point must be zero.
* **Electric field intensity** at any point is the strength of electric field at that point. It is defined as the force experienced by unit positive charge placed at that point.
* **Formula:** If $F$ is the force acting on a test charge $+q_0$ at any point, then electric field intensity at this point is given by $E=\frac{F}{q_0}$.
    



* Electric field is a vector quantity.
* **SI unit:** Since force is measured in newton (N) and charge is measured in coulomb (C), electric field intensity is measured in **newton per coulomb (N/C)**.
