# REFRACTION
The phenomenon of change in the path of light as it travels from one medium to another is called refraction.

## Laws of Refraction
(a) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the refracting surface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
(b) Also the ratio of sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media.

Where ${ }_1 \mu_2$ is the refractive index of second medium with respect of first medium. If ${ }_1 \mu_2$ is greater than 1 then light ray bends towards normal and if ${ }_1 \mu_2$ is less than 1 , then right ray bends away from normal.  
Equation (i) is known as Snell's law of refraction.  
As $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r}={ }_1 \mu_2=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1}$, when there are several media we can say,

$
\frac{\sin i_1}{\sin i_2}=\frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} \Rightarrow \mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2
$

Hence, $\mu_1 \sin i_1=\mu_2 \sin i_2=\mu_3 \sin i_3=$ constant or $\mu \sin i=$ constant.
This equation is found to be very useful for solving problems involving a variable refractive index.

A ray of light is incident on a substance ( $x$ ) at an angle of incidence of $60^{\circ}$. If the angle of refraction were $37^{\circ}$. Calculate the refractive index of substance $(x)$.

**Solution:**
Given:
- Angle of incidence (i) = 60째
- Angle of refraction (r) = 37째
- Light travels from air (medium 1) to substance x (medium 2)

Using Snell's law:
$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \frac{\mu_2}{\mu_1} = {}_1\mu_2$

Since medium 1 is air, $\mu_1 = 1$
Therefore, $\mu_2 = {}_1\mu_2$

$\mu_2 = \frac{\sin 60째}{\sin 37째}$

$\mu_2 = \frac{0.866}{0.602} = 1.44$

Therefore, the refractive index of substance x is 1.44.
