## Section - A

### Problem 1: Prove that in a spherical mirror, magnification is also equal to $m=\frac{f}{f-u}$.

**Solution:**

Using mirror equation $\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Rightarrow v=\frac{u f}{u-f} \\
& \Rightarrow-\frac{v}{u}=\frac{f}{f-u} \\
& m=\frac{f}{f-u} .
\end{aligned}
$$

### Problem 2: An object is placed at a distance of 12 cm from a concave mirror of radius of curvature 16 cm. Find the position of image.

**Solution:** $f=-16 / 2=-8 \mathrm{~cm}, u=-12 \mathrm{~cm}$
Using $\frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{1}{v}+\frac{1}{-12}=\frac{1}{-8} \\
& \Rightarrow v=-24 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{aligned}
$$

Image is formed at a distance of **24 cm** in front of mirror.

### Problem 3: What is difference between the virtual images produced by (i) plane mirror. (ii) concave mirror (iii) convex mirror?

**Solution:**
(i) The virtual image produced by a plane mirror is of the same size as the object.
(ii) The virtual image produced by a concave mirror is magnified.
(iii) The virtual image produced by a convex mirror is diminished in size.

### Problem 4: An object is placed on the principal axis of the concave lens at a distance of **20 cm** from it. If the focal length of the lens is also 20 cm , find the location of the image.

**Solution:**

Using, $\frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{f} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{v}-\frac{1}{-20}=\frac{1}{-20} \Rightarrow v=-10 \mathrm{~cm}$
The image is formed at a distance of 10 cm from lens, in the middle of object and lens.

### Problem 5: Light travelling in a medium with velocity <span class="math-inline">3 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm\{\~m\} / \\mathrm\{s\}</span> is refracted into the second medium in which it travels with velocity <span class="math-inline">2 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm\{\~m\} / \\mathrm\{s\}</span>. What is the refractive index of the second medium?

**Solution:** <span class="math-inline">\\eta\_2\=\\frac\{v\_1\}\{v\_2\}\=\\frac\{3 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm\{\~ms\}^\{\-1\}\}\{2 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm\{\~ms\}^\{\-1\}\}\=\\frac\{3\}\{2\}\=1\.5</span>.

### Problem 6: The image obtained with a convex lens is erect and its length is 3 times the length of the object. If the focal length of the lens is 15 cm , calculate the distance of the image formed.

**Solution:** Let <span class="math-inline">0\=x, \\therefore 1\=3 x, f\=15 \\mathrm\{\~cm\}</span>
Using, <span class="math-inline">m\=\\frac\{1\}\{0\}\=3</span>
But <span class="math-inline">\\quad m\=\\frac\{v\}\{u\} \\quad \\therefore \\quad v\=3 u</span>
Using <span class="math-inline">\\frac\{1\}\{f\}\=\-\\frac\{1\}\{u\}\+\\frac\{1\}\{v\}</span>

<span class="math-block">\\begin\{array\}\{ll\}
\\therefore & \\frac\{1\}\{15\}\=\-\\frac\{1\}\{u\}\+\\frac\{1\}\{3 u\}\=\\frac\{\-2\}\{3 u\} \\\\
\\therefore & u\=\-\\frac\{2\}\{3\} \\times 15\=\-10 \\mathrm\{\~cm\}
\\end\{array\}</span>

Substituting the value of <span class="math-inline">u</span> in (i), we get, <span class="math-inline">v\=3 \\times\(\-10\)\=\-30 \\mathrm\{\~cm\}</span>.

### Problem 7: When an object is placed at a distance of 0.60 m from a convex spherical mirror, the magnification produced is <span class="math-inline">\\frac\{1\}\{2\}</span>. Where should the object be placed to get magnification of <span class="math-inline">\\frac\{1\}\{3\}</span> ?

**Solution:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Case I: } \frac{1}{2}=\frac{f}{f+0.60} \Rightarrow \quad f=+0.60 \mathrm{~m
