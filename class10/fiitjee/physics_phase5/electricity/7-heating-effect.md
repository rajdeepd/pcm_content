# HEATING EFFECT OF CURRENT
When a free charge $Q$ moves under the potential difference $V$, we say that its electric potential energy decreases by U , where

$
U=Q V
$


Also we know, $\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{t} \quad \Rightarrow \mathrm{Q}=\mathrm{it}$
from the ohm's law $V=i R$
Hence, $U=(i t)(i R)=i^2 R t$
This decrease in electrical potential energy appears as heat produced, $(H)$ in time $t$

$
H=i^2 R t
$

A current of 4A passes through a resistance of $100 \Omega$ for 15 minutes. Calculate the heat produced in calories.

**Solution**: The heat produced is $\mathrm{U}=\mathrm{i}^2 \mathrm{Rt}=(4 \mathrm{~A})^2 \times(100 \Omega) \times(15 \times 60 \mathrm{~s})=1.44 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~J}$.
Now, $4.186 \mathrm{~J}=1 \mathrm{cal}$.
Thus, $1.44 \times 10^6 \mathrm{~J}=\frac{1.44 \times 10^6}{4.186} \mathrm{cal}=3.4 \times 10^5 \mathrm{cal}$.

The coil of a heater is cut into two equal halves and only one of them is used into heater. What is the ratio of the heat produced by this half coil to that by the original coil?

**Solution**: The resistance of half part of a coil $=R / 2$

$
\begin{array}{ll}
\therefore & \text { Heat produced } H^{\prime}=\frac{V^2 t}{R / 2} \text {; Original heat produced, } H=V^2 t / R . \\
\therefore & \frac{H^{\prime}}{H}=2
\end{array}
