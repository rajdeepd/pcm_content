# POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

If various charged particles are distributed in space, then an external charge, $q$, will experience a force due to other charges in the space. Let a person move this charge slowly from point $A$ to point $B$, while all other charges are at rest. Then, let us say work done by the person is $W$. Then potential difference, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}$ $V_A$, is defined as work done per unit charge in taking it from $A$ to $B$,

$
V_B-V_A=W / q
$

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{B}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ are called as potentials at the two points. Potential, V at a point is defined as the work done per unit charge in bringing a charge from infinity to that point.

$
\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{q}
$


Potential is measured in volts,

$
1 \text { volt = } 1 \text { Joule } / 1 \text { Coulomb }
$


**Exercise 1:**

How much energy is given to each coulomb of charge passing through a 6 V battery?
