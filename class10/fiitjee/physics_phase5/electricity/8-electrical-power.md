# ELECTRICAL POWER

Power is the rate at which work is being done or energy is transferred (produced or consumed) from one body to other. In electrical circuits energy often appears to dissipate in the form of heat. Thus, the heat produced per unit time is called power $(P)$.

$
\begin{aligned}
& P=U / t=H / t=i^2 R \\
& \text { Since, } i R=V \\
& \text { Hence, } P=V^2 / R \\
& \text { And } P=V i
\end{aligned}
$


The unit of power is watt,


1 watt = 1 Joule $/ 1$ second  
As electrical energy is the product of power and time, the unit of electrical energy is, therefore, watt-hour or kilowatt-hour. The kilowatt-hour is the energy consumed.
when 1000 watt of power is used for 1 hour

$
\begin{aligned}
& 1 \mathrm{KWh}=1000 \text { watt } \times 3600 \text { seconds } \\
& =3.6 \times 10^6 \text { Joules }
\end{aligned}
