# FORMULAS AND CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE

1. Electric Charges are found to be made up of integral multiples of a smallest amount of charge. This smallest amount of charge is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$ coulomb.
Thus, any charged body will have a charge

    $
    Q=n e
    $


    Where $n$ is the number of electrons.
2. Electron current is the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time.

    $
    I=\frac{Q}{t}
    $


    The S.I. unit of electric current is ampere (A) One ampere is the current if one coulomb of charge flows in one second, that is, $1 \mathrm{~A}=1 \mathrm{C} / 1 \mathrm{~s}$.
3. Electric potential is the electrical state of a conductor which determines the direction of flow of charges when the two conductors are either kept in contact or they are joined by a metallic wire. Electrons flow from lower potential to higher potential.
4. Elecrric potential is a scalar quantity and its unit is 'Volt'.
4. Ohm's law states that the potential difference V , across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided its temperature remains the same.

    $
    V=I R
    $


    Constant $R$ is called resistance for the given metallic wire at a given temperature.

5. Resistivity or specific resistance of a material is equal to the resistance of a wire of that material of 1 meter length and $1 \mathrm{~m}^2$ area of across section.

    Resistivity

    $
    \rho=\frac{R A}{\ell}
    $


    Unit of specific resistance is 'ohm meter' $(\Omega \mathrm{m})$. Resistivity or specific resistance is the property of a material, its value does not depend on shape and size of the conductor.

6. In series combination
(i) Equivalent resistance $R=R_1+R_2+R_3$
(ii) Current passes same through each resistor.
7. In parallel combination
(i) Equivalent resistance $\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}$
(ii) Potential across each resistor is same.
8. Electrical energy $W=V I=I^2 R t=\frac{V^2}{R} t$ joule, S.I. unit of energy is joule (J).
9. Electrical appliances such as electric bulb, heater, geyser etc are rated with power ( P ) and voltage (V). From this rating, we can calculate the resistance of the filament of the appliance and also current flowing through it.
As power $P=\frac{V^2}{R}$
$\therefore$ Resistance $R=\frac{V^2}{P}$
Also current $I=\frac{P}{V}$.
