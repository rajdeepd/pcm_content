## MOVEMENT OF CHARGE

A free positive charge moves from a region of higher potential to that of a lower potential and a free negative charge moves from a region of lower potential to that of a higher potential. Therefore we can say a potential difference is required for the flow of the free charge. The flow of charge is called an electric current.
The charge passing through a given point per unit time is called as electric current at that place.

$
\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{Q} / \mathrm{t}
$


The unit of electric current is Ampere.

$
1 \text { Ampere = } 1 \text { Coulomb } / 1 \text { second }
$


The direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of negative charges.

**Illustration 1:**
$6 \times 10^{17}$ electrons cross through an area per minute. What is the electric current?
Solution:

$
\text { The current is } \mathrm{i}=\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{t}}=\frac{6 \times 10^{17} \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}}{60}=1.6 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}=1.6 \mathrm{~mA}
$
