# RATINGS OF EQUIPMENTS AND APPLIANCES
You may have observed the specifications written on electric appliances like bulbs, tubes electric iron etc. When you look at them carefully, you may find (for example on a bulb) $40 \mathrm{~W}, 220 \mathrm{~V}$. What does it mean? It means that whenever it will be connected to a 220 V supply it will give a power output of 40 W . It also means that the resistance offered to the current by its filament is $R=(220)^2 / 40$. It also means that this resistance will remain same even if it is connected to any other supply, say, 440 V .

Calculate the wattage of an electric heater which draws 5 A current when connected to a 220 V power supply.

Solution: The wattage is $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{Vi}=(220 \mathrm{~A}) \times(5 \mathrm{~A})=1100 \mathrm{~W}$.

A bulb is rated 40 W, 220 V. Find the current drawn by it when it is connected to a 220 V supply.

Solution: Since the bulb is rated at 220 V and it connected to a 220 V supply, the power consumed will be 40 W . the current drawn by it is $i=\frac{P}{V}=\frac{40 \mathrm{~W}}{220 \mathrm{~V}}=\frac{2}{11} \mathrm{~A}$.

$\bar{A}$ bulb is rated $40 \mathrm{~W}, 220 \mathrm{~V}$. Find the current drawn by it when it is connected to a 110 V supply.

Solution: Since the bulb is rated at 220 V its resistance will be given by $\mathrm{V}^2 \mathrm{~W}=\mathrm{R}$ and is equal to $220 \times 220 / 40$ ohm. Therefore the current is V/R and is equal to $1 / 11$.

Determine the potential difference between the ends of a wire of resistance $5 \Omega$ if 720 coulomb charge passes through it per minute.

Solution: $I=Q / t$
or, $\mathrm{I}=\frac{720}{60}=12 \mathrm{~A}$
By Ohm's law, $V=I R \quad$ or, $V=(12 A)(5 \Omega)=60$ Volt.

Two electric bulbs have 40 W and 60 W rating at 220 V . Find the ratio of their resistances.
Solution: $\quad$ Since, $\mathrm{R}=\mathrm{V}^2 / \mathrm{P}$
Since $V$ is the same for both the bulb.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \therefore R \propto 1 / P \\
& \therefore \frac{R_1}{R_2}=\frac{P_2}{P_1}=\frac{60}{40} \Rightarrow \frac{R_1}{R_2}=\frac{3}{2} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The current in a circuit having constant resistance is tripled. How does this affect the power dissipation?
Solution: The power dissipated in a circuit $P=I^2 R$
Thus $\mathrm{P} \propto \mathrm{I}^2$, when R is constant. When I becomes three times, P becomes nine times i.e. Power dissipation becomes 9 times.

Calculate the current passing through a bulb rated $60 \mathrm{~W}, 240 \mathrm{~V}$ when it is connected to a supply of 120 V
Solution: Resistance of bulb rated at $60 \mathrm{~W}, 240 \mathrm{~V}$ is

$$
\mathrm{R}=\frac{\mathrm{V}^2}{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{240 \times 240}{60}=960 \Omega
$$


Current Passing through the bulb when connected to 120 V supply is,

$$
\mathrm{I}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{R}}=\frac{120}{960}=0.125 \mathrm{~A}
$$

How many units of energy is consumed in operating ten 50 watt bulbs for 10 hrs per day in a month (30 days).

Solution: Units of energy consumed for 30 days $=\frac{\text { Watt } \times \text { hours }}{1000} \times 30$

$
=\frac{10 \times 50 \times 10}{1000} \times 30=15 \mathrm{kWh} .

An electric refrigerator rated 400 W operates 8 hour/day. What is the cost of the energy to operate it for 30 days at Rs. 3.00 per kwh?

Solution: $ \text{Watts per day} = \text{3200} W / day, 3200 x30 hours per month$   
cost for one month= $96 x3 = 288 \text{ Rs} $

An electric heater is rated at $500 \mathrm{~W}, 220 \mathrm{~V}$. If it is connected across a 110 V supply, find the amount of electrical energy consumed by the heater in 3 hrs .

**Solution:** Resistance of the heater $=\frac{\mathrm{V}^2}{\mathrm{P}}=\frac{(220)^2}{500}$
Current through the heater when it is connected across a 110 V supply, (i) $=\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{R}$

$$
=\frac{110 \times 500}{(220)^2}=\frac{25}{22} \mathrm{~A}
$$


Amount of electrical energy consumed,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =i^2 \mathrm{RT}=\left(\frac{25}{22}\right)^2 \times \frac{(22)^2}{5} \times 3 \\
& =125 \times 3 \text { watt-hours } \\
& =375 \text { watt-hrs }=0.375 \mathrm{kw}-\mathrm{hrs} .
\end{aligned}
$$
