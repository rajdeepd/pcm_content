## Solutions

**Problem 1**: Identify the type of chemical reaction represented by: $\mathrm{Pb(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2KI(aq) \longrightarrow PbI_2(s) + 2KNO_3(aq)}$

**Solution**: Double displacement reaction (also known as precipitation reaction, as PbI₂ forms as a solid precipitate)

**Problem 2**: What term describes a reaction where a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances?

**Solution**: Decomposition reaction

**Problem 3**: In terms of electron transfer, what is the defining characteristic of an oxidation reaction?

**Solution**: Loss of electrons

**Problem 4**: Explain the difference between a decomposition reaction and a single displacement reaction.

**Solution**: In a decomposition reaction, a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances (A → B + C). In a single displacement reaction, an element displaces another element from a compound (A + BC → AC + B).

**Problem 5**: Balance the following chemical equation:
$\mathrm{C_3H_8} + \mathrm{O_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO_2} + \mathrm{H_2O}$

**Solution**: $\mathrm{C_3H_8} + 5\mathrm{O_2} \longrightarrow 3\mathrm{CO_2} + 4\mathrm{H_2O}$

**Problem 6**: Balance the following chemical equation:
$\mathrm{AgNO_3} + \mathrm{MgCl_2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{AgCl} + \mathrm{Mg(NO_3)_2}$

**Solution**: $2\mathrm{AgNO_3} + \mathrm{MgCl_2} \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{AgCl} + \mathrm{Mg(NO_3)_2}$

**Problem 7**: Consider the following redox reaction:
$\mathrm{MnO_2(s) + 4HCl(aq) \longrightarrow MnCl_2(aq) + Cl_2(g) + 2H_2O(l)}$
Identify:
(i) The oxidizing agent
(ii) The substance reduced
(iii) The substance oxidized

**Solution**:
(i) The oxidizing agent is MnO₂
(ii) The substance reduced is MnO₂ (Mn⁴⁺ is reduced to Mn²⁺)
(iii) The substance oxidized is HCl (Cl⁻ is oxidized to Cl₂)

**Problem 8**: In the formation of a compound $X_2Y_3$, atoms of element $X$ lost 3 electrons each, while atoms of element $Y$ gained 2 electrons each. Which element is reduced in this process?

**Solution**: Element Y is reduced (as it gains electrons)

**Problem 9**: In the formation of a compound $X_2Y_3$, atoms of element $X$ lost 3 electrons each, while atoms of element $Y$ gained 2 electrons each. Which element acts as the reducing agent?

**Solution**: Element X acts as the reducing agent (as it donates electrons)

**Problem 10**: Write the correctly balanced chemical equation for the reaction between aqueous barium chloride and aqueous sodium sulfate, and state the type of reaction.

**Solution**: $\mathrm{BaCl_2(aq) + Na_2SO_4(aq) \longrightarrow BaSO_4(s) + 2NaCl(aq)}$
This is a double displacement reaction (also a precipitation reaction, as BaSO₄ forms as a solid precipitate).
