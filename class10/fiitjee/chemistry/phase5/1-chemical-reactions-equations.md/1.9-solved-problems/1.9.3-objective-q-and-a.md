## Multiple Choice Questions (Single Option Correct)

 ### Problem 1

Copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid and liberates:  
(A) Nitrogen dioxide.  
(B) Nitric oxide.  
(C) Nitrogen pentoxide.  
(D) Nitrous oxide. 

**Solution:** (A).
To solve this question, we need to consider the reaction of copper with nitric acid. The products of this reaction depend on the concentration of the nitric acid.

When copper reacts with **concentrated** nitric acid, the main gaseous product is **nitrogen dioxide (NOâ‚‚)**.
The balanced chemical equation is:
$\mathrm{Cu} + 4\mathrm{HNO}_3 (\text{conc.}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu(NO_3)_2} + 2\mathrm{NO}_2 + 2\mathrm{H_2O}$

When copper reacts with **dilute** nitric acid, the main gaseous product is **nitric oxide (NO)**.
The balanced chemical equation is:
$3\mathrm{Cu} + 8\mathrm{HNO}_3 (\text{dilute}) \longrightarrow 3\mathrm{Cu(NO_3)_2} + 2\mathrm{NO} + 4\mathrm{H_2O}$

The question does not specify the concentration of the nitric acid. However, looking back at the original problem set where this question came from, the solution provided indicated nitrogen dioxide as the answer and gave a reaction with "(Conc.)" written below the nitric acid.

Therefore, assuming concentrated nitric acid is used, the correct answer is:

**(A) Nitrogen dioxide**
### Problem 2

Identify the type of reaction taking place in $\mathrm{Fe}+\mathrm{CuSO}_4 \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cu}+\mathrm{FeSO}_4$:
(A) Redox reaction
(B) Displacement reaction
(C) Neutralization reaction
(D) Both (A) and (B)

**Solution:** (D). Displacement reactions, where a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution, are inherently redox reactions involving the transfer of electrons.

### Problem 3

On addition of which metal will the blue coloured copper sulphate solution turn into a colourless solution?
(A) Ag
(B) Hg
(C) Zn
(D) $A u$

**Solution:** (C). The reaction is:  
$\mathrm{Zn}+\underset{\text { (Blue) }}{\mathrm{CuSO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) \longrightarrow \underset{\text { (Colouriess) }}{\mathrm{ZnSO}_4(\mathrm{aq})}+\mathrm{Cu}}$

Zinc is more reactive than copper and displaces it from the copper sulfate solution, forming colourless zinc sulfate.

### Problem 4

The chemical reaction $\mathrm{HNO}_3+\mathrm{KOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{KNO}_3+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$ is an example of:
(A) Neutralization
(B) Double displacement
(C) Neutralization and double displacement
(D) Combination

**Solution:** (C). This reaction involves an acid ($\mathrm{HNO}_3$) reacting with a base ($\mathrm{KOH}$) to form a salt ($\mathrm{KNO}_3$) and water ($\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$), which is the definition of a neutralization reaction. It is also a double displacement reaction because the ions of the reactants exchange places.

### Problem 5

A substance $A$ reacts with another substance $B$ to produce the product $C$ and a gas $D$. If a mixture of the gas $D$ and ammonia is passed through an aqueous solution of $C$, baking soda is formed. The Substances $A$ and $B$ are:
(A) HCl and NaOH
(B) HCl and $\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{CO}_3$
(C) Na and $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$
(D) $\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{CO}_3$ and $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$

**Solution:** (B). Let's analyze the information:
* Gas $D$ reacts with ammonia and an aqueous solution of $C$ to form baking soda ($\mathrm{NaHCO}_3$). This suggests that gas $D$ is carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO}_2$) and substance $C$ is sodium chloride ($\mathrm{NaCl}$). The reaction to form baking soda is: $\mathrm{NaCl} + \mathrm{NH}_3 + \mathrm{CO}_2 + \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaHCO}_3 + \mathrm{NH}_4\mathrm{Cl}$.
* Substances $A$ and $B$ react to produce $C$ ($\mathrm{NaCl}$) and gas $D$ ($\mathrm{CO}_2$). The reaction between hydrochloric acid ($\mathrm{HCl}$) and sodium carbonate ($\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{CO}_3$) produces sodium chloride, carbon dioxide, and water: $2\mathrm{HCl} + \mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{CO}_3 \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{NaCl} + \mathrm{CO}_2 + \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$.
Therefore, substances $A$ and $B$ are $\mathrm{HCl}$ and $\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{CO}_3$.
