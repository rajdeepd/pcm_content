# Chemical Reactions and Equations

## Introduction
Chemical reactions are the process in which new substances with new properties are formed.
Chemical reactions involve the breaking of bonds between the atoms of the reacting substances and making of new bonds between the atoms of products.
During chemical reactions a large variety of rearrangement of atoms can take place. to produce new substances having entirely different properties.
The rusting of iron objects on exposure to moist air, the changing of milk into curd and digestion of food in our body are all examples of chemical reactions.
The following observations can help us to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place or not:  
**Change in state**
* Change in colour
* Evolution of a gas
* Change in temperature

A chemical reaction is represented in short form by writing a chemical equation.
