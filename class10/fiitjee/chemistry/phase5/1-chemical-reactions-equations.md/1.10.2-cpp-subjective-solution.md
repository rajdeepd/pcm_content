# CHAPTER PRACTICE PROBLEMS
## SUBJECTIVE SUBJECTIVE SOLUTION

### Section-1


**1. Why respiration considered as an exothermic reaction? Explain.**

Respiration is considered an exothermic reaction because it releases energy in the form of heat. During cellular respiration, glucose reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy:

$\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6 + 6\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\mathrm{CO}_2 + 6\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \text{Energy}$

This process is exothermic because:
- The chemical bonds formed in the products (CO₂ and H₂O) are stronger than the bonds broken in the reactants
- The reaction releases approximately 686 kcal of energy per mole of glucose
- Some of this energy is captured as ATP, while the rest is released as heat, maintaining body temperature
- The negative enthalpy change (ΔH < 0) confirms it's an exothermic process

**2. What do you mean by exothermic and endothermic reactions? Give examples.**

**Exothermic Reactions:**
- Definition: Reactions that release energy (usually as heat) to the surroundings
- Energy change: ΔH is negative
- Temperature change: The surroundings become warmer
- Examples:
  1. Combustion of fuels: $\mathrm{CH}_4 + 2\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \text{Energy}$
  2. Neutralization reactions: $\mathrm{NaOH} + \mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{NaCl} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \text{Heat}$
  3. Respiration: $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6 + 6\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\mathrm{CO}_2 + 6\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \text{Energy}$

**Endothermic Reactions:**
- Definition: Reactions that absorb energy (usually as heat) from the surroundings
- Energy change: ΔH is positive
- Temperature change: The surroundings become cooler
- Examples:
  1. Photosynthesis: $6\mathrm{CO}_2 + 6\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \text{Light energy} \rightarrow \mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6 + 6\mathrm{O}_2$
  2. Thermal decomposition of limestone: $\mathrm{CaCO}_3 + \text{Heat} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaO} + \mathrm{CO}_2$
  3. Melting of ice: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s}) + \text{Heat} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})$

**3. What do you mean by precipitation reactions? Explain giving examples.**

Precipitation reactions are chemical reactions in which two soluble compounds in aqueous solution react to form an insoluble solid called a precipitate.

Characteristics of precipitation reactions:
- They are typically double displacement reactions
- The precipitate forms when the product exceeds its solubility limit
- They are often used in qualitative analysis to identify ions

Examples:

1. Silver nitrate and sodium chloride:
   $\mathrm{AgNO}_3(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s}) \downarrow + \mathrm{NaNO}_3(\mathrm{aq})$
   
   The white precipitate of silver chloride forms immediately.

2. Lead nitrate and potassium iodide:
   $\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_2(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{KI}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{PbI}_2(\mathrm{s}) \downarrow + 2\mathrm{KNO}_3(\mathrm{aq})$
   
   A yellow precipitate of lead iodide forms.

3. Barium chloride and sodium sulfate:
   $\mathrm{BaCl}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Na}_2\mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{BaSO}_4(\mathrm{s}) \downarrow + 2\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq})$
   
   A white precipitate of barium sulfate forms.

**4. Can we stir silver nitrate with a copper spoon? Why or why not?**

No, we cannot stir silver nitrate solution with a copper spoon. This is because a displacement reaction will occur between copper metal and silver nitrate solution.

Explanation:
- When copper metal comes in contact with silver nitrate solution, a single displacement reaction occurs:
  $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{AgNO}_3(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_2(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{Ag}(\mathrm{s})$

- This reaction occurs because copper is more reactive than silver in the reactivity series of metals.
- Copper has a greater tendency to lose electrons (get oxidized) than silver.
- In this reaction:
  * Copper is oxidized: $\mathrm{Cu} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^-$
  * Silver ions are reduced: $\mathrm{Ag}^+ + \mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow \mathrm{Ag}$

Consequences:
1. The copper spoon would gradually dissolve as copper atoms enter the solution as Cu²⁺ ions.
2. Metallic silver would be deposited as a gray or black coating on the spoon's surface.
3. The blue color of copper(II) nitrate would develop in the solution.
4. The silver nitrate solution would be contaminated and its concentration would decrease.

This is a practical example of a redox reaction demonstrating the relative positions of copper and silver in the reactivity series.

**5. Define oxidation and reduction in terms of (i) Oxygen (ii) Hydrogen (iii) Electrons. Give one example each.**

Oxidation and reduction can be defined in three different ways:

(i) In terms of Oxygen:
- **Oxidation**: Addition of oxygen to a substance or removal of hydrogen from a substance.
- **Reduction**: Removal of oxygen from a substance or addition of hydrogen to a substance.

Example: $2\mathrm{Cu} + \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{CuO}$
- Copper is oxidized as it gains oxygen to form copper oxide.

(ii) In terms of Hydrogen:
- **Oxidation**: Removal of hydrogen from a substance.
- **Reduction**: Addition of hydrogen to a substance.

Example: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{S} + \mathrm{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{HCl} + \mathrm{S}$
- Hydrogen sulfide is oxidized as hydrogen is removed from it.
- Chlorine is reduced as it gains hydrogen to form hydrogen chloride.

(iii) In terms of Electrons:
- **Oxidation**: Loss of electrons by a substance.
- **Reduction**: Gain of electrons by a substance.

Example: $\mathrm{Zn} + \mathrm{Cu}^{2+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+} + \mathrm{Cu}$
- Zinc is oxidized as it loses electrons: $\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^-$
- Copper ions are reduced as they gain electrons: $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$

**6. Explain why freshly cut apple is almost white but it turns reddish brown after some time?**

A freshly cut apple turns reddish-brown due to an oxidation reaction involving enzymes:

1. When an apple is cut, its cells are damaged, exposing the cellular contents to air.
2. The apple contains an enzyme called polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and compounds called polyphenols.
3. In the presence of oxygen from the air, the enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of polyphenols to form quinones.
4. These quinones undergo further reactions to form melanin, which is a brown-colored pigment.

The chemical process:
- Polyphenols (colorless) + O₂ → Quinones (brown) → Melanin (darker brown)

This process is a form of enzymatic browning and is an example of an oxidation reaction in everyday life. The browning can be slowed by:
- Limiting oxygen exposure (wrapping tightly)
- Adding antioxidants like lemon juice (vitamin C)
- Refrigerating (slows enzyme activity)
- Blanching (heat inactivates the enzymes)

**7. Justify that the reaction: $2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{s})+3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})+2\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$ is a redox reaction. Identify oxidant and reductant.**

To justify that this is a redox reaction, we need to determine if oxidation and reduction are occurring simultaneously by analyzing the oxidation states of elements:

In $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}$:
- Oxidation state of Cu: +1 (since S typically has -2)
- Oxidation state of S: -2

In $\mathrm{O}_2$:
- Oxidation state of O: 0 (free element)

In $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O}$:
- Oxidation state of Cu: +1 (remains unchanged)
- Oxidation state of O: -2

In $\mathrm{SO}_2$:
- Oxidation state of S: +4
- Oxidation state of O: -2

Changes in oxidation states:
- Sulfur: -2 → +4 (increase of 6, oxidation)
- Oxygen: 0 → -2 (decrease of 2, reduction)

Therefore, this is a redox reaction because:
- Sulfur in $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}$ is oxidized (loses electrons)
- Oxygen in $\mathrm{O}_2$ is reduced (gains electrons)

Identification:
- Oxidant (oxidizing agent): $\mathrm{O}_2$ (causes oxidation of sulfur)
- Reductant (reducing agent): $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}$ (specifically the sulfur in copper(I) sulfide)

**8. Show that the reaction: $\mathrm{PbO}+2\mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{PbCl}_2+\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ follows law of conservation of mass.**

To show that this reaction follows the law of conservation of mass, we need to verify that the total mass of reactants equals the total mass of products.

Step 1: Calculate the molecular masses of all compounds involved.
- $\mathrm{PbO}$: Pb (207.2) + O (16.0) = 223.2 g/mol
- $\mathrm{HCl}$: H (1.0) + Cl (35.5) = 36.5 g/mol
- $\mathrm{PbCl}_2$: Pb (207.2) + 2 × Cl (35.5) = 278.2 g/mol
- $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$: 2 × H (1.0) + O (16.0) = 18.0 g/mol

Step 2: Calculate the total mass of reactants.
- $\mathrm{PbO}$: 223.2 g/mol
- $2\mathrm{HCl}$: 2 × 36.5 g/mol = 73.0 g/mol
- Total mass of reactants: 223.2 + 73.0 = 296.2 g/mol

Step 3: Calculate the total mass of products.
- $\mathrm{PbCl}_2$: 278.2 g/mol
- $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$: 18.0 g/mol
- Total mass of products: 278.2 + 18.0 = 296.2 g/mol

Since the total mass of reactants (296.2 g/mol) equals the total mass of products (296.2 g/mol), the reaction follows the law of conservation of mass.

This demonstrates that in a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed, only rearranged.

**9. Why iron corrodes but aluminium does not?**

Iron corrodes readily while aluminum appears resistant to corrosion due to their different behaviors when exposed to oxygen:

**Iron Corrosion:**
1. When iron is exposed to oxygen and moisture, it forms hydrated iron(III) oxide (rust): $4\mathrm{Fe} + 3\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{O}_3 \cdot \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$
2. Rust is porous and flaky, allowing oxygen and water to penetrate further.
3. This exposes fresh iron underneath, continuing the corrosion process.
4. The rust layer does not adhere well to the iron surface and often flakes off.

**Aluminum Resistance:**
1. Aluminum also reacts with oxygen to form aluminum oxide: $4\mathrm{Al} + 3\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$
2. However, the aluminum oxide forms a thin, continuous, and highly adherent layer on the surface.
3. This oxide layer is impermeable to oxygen and water, preventing further oxidation.
4. The process is called passivation, and the protective layer is self-healing if damaged.

The key difference is that aluminum oxide forms a protective barrier that prevents further corrosion, while iron oxide allows corrosion to continue. This is why aluminum structures can last for decades without significant corrosion, while unprotected iron rusts quickly.

**10. Explain different types of decomposition reactions with suitable examples.**

Decomposition reactions are chemical reactions in which a single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances. The main types are:

**1. Thermal Decomposition:**
- Occurs when a substance breaks down upon heating
- Example: $\mathrm{CaCO}_3 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{CaO} + \mathrm{CO}_2$
  (Calcium carbonate decomposes to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when heated)
- Another example: $2\mathrm{KClO}_3 \xrightarrow{\Delta} 2\mathrm{KCl} + 3\mathrm{O}_2$
  (Potassium chlorate decomposes to potassium chloride and oxygen)

**2. Electrolytic Decomposition:**
- Occurs when an electric current is passed through a compound in molten state or in solution
- Example: $2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text{electricity}} 2\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{O}_2$
  (Water decomposes to hydrogen and oxygen gases)
- Another example: $2\mathrm{NaCl} \xrightarrow{\text{electricity}} 2\mathrm{Na} + \mathrm{Cl}_2$
  (Molten sodium chloride decomposes to sodium metal and chlorine gas)

**3. Photochemical Decomposition:**
- Occurs when a substance breaks down in the presence of light
- Example: $2\mathrm{AgBr} \xrightarrow{\text{light}} 2\mathrm{Ag} + \mathrm{Br}_2$
  (Silver bromide decomposes to silver and bromine in photography)
- Another example: $2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\text{light}} 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2$
  (Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to water and oxygen)

**4. Catalytic Decomposition:**
- Occurs when a catalyst accelerates the decomposition process
- Example: $2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\mathrm{MnO}_2} 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2$
  (Hydrogen peroxide decomposes to water and oxygen in the presence of manganese dioxide)
- Another example: $2\mathrm{KClO}_3 \xrightarrow{\mathrm{MnO}_2} 2\mathrm{KCl} + 3\mathrm{O}_2$
  (Potassium chlorate decomposes faster in the presence of manganese dioxide)

**11. Differentiate between: (a) Rancidity and corrosion (b) Valency and oxidation No.**

**(a) Rancidity vs. Corrosion:**

| Rancidity | Corrosion |
|-----------|-----------|
| Occurs in food items containing fats and oils | Occurs in metals and alloys |
| Results from oxidation of oils and fats | Results from oxidation of metals |
| Produces unpleasant smell and taste | Produces metal oxides (like rust) |
| Affects food quality and nutritional value | Affects structural integrity and appearance |
| Can be prevented by antioxidants, proper storage, refrigeration | Can be prevented by painting, galvanization, alloying |
| Example: Spoiled butter or old cooking oil | Example: Rusting of iron |
| Relatively faster process | Can be slow or fast depending on conditions |

**(b) Valency vs. Oxidation Number:**

| Valency | Oxidation Number |
|---------|-----------------|
| Represents the combining capacity of an atom | Represents the apparent charge on an atom in a compound |
| Based on electron transfer or sharing | Based on electron shift according to electronegativity |
| Always a positive number | Can be positive, negative, or zero |
| Fixed for an element (though may have multiple valencies) | Can vary depending on the compound |
| Used primarily to understand bonding | Used to track electron transfers in redox reactions |
| Example: Valency of Na is 1, O is 2 | Example: Oxidation number of Na in NaCl is +1, O in H₂O is -2 |
| Not assigned to elements in free state | Free elements have oxidation number of zero |

**12. Explain the following terms: (a) Double displacement reaction (b) Auto Oxidation (c) Spectator ions**

**(a) Double Displacement Reaction:**
A chemical reaction in which the positive and negative ions of two compounds exchange places to form two new compounds.

Characteristics:
- Generally occurs in aqueous solutions
- Often results in precipitation, gas formation, or water formation
- Can be represented as: AB + CD → AD + CB

Examples:
1. $\mathrm{AgNO}_3(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{NaNO}_3(\mathrm{aq})$
2. $\mathrm{BaCl}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Na}_2\mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{BaSO}_4(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq})$

**(b) Auto Oxidation:**
A process in which a substance acts as both an oxidizing and reducing agent, with different atoms of the same element undergoing different changes in oxidation state.

Characteristics:
- One part of the molecule is oxidized while another part is reduced
- The overall oxidation state of the element appears to increase and decrease simultaneously
- Often occurs in compounds with intermediate oxidation states

Examples:
1. Disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide: $2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + \mathrm{O}_2$
   - Oxygen in H₂O₂ has an oxidation state of -1
   - In H₂O, oxygen has an oxidation state of -2 (reduction)
   - In O₂, oxygen has an oxidation state of 0 (oxidation)

2. Disproportionation of chlorine in water: $\mathrm{Cl}_2 + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCl} + \mathrm{HOCl}$
   - Chlorine (0) is both oxidized to +1 in HOCl and reduced to -1 in HCl

**(c) Spectator Ions:**
Ions that are present in a solution but do not participate in the chemical reaction.

Characteristics:
- Remain unchanged throughout the reaction
- Appear on both sides of the chemical equation
- Can be eliminated when writing net ionic equations
- Do not affect the outcome of the reaction

Example:
In the reaction between sodium chloride and silver nitrate:
$\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{AgNO}_3(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{NaNO}_3(\mathrm{aq})$

The complete ionic equation is:
$\mathrm{Na}^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Cl}^-(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Ag}^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{NO}_3^-(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{Na}^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{NO}_3^-(\mathrm{aq})$

The spectator ions are $\mathrm{Na}^+$ and $\mathrm{NO}_3^-$ because they appear unchanged on both sides.

The net ionic equation (without spectator ions) is:
$\mathrm{Ag}^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Cl}^-(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$

**13. (a) What do you understand by the term direct redox reaction and indirect redox reaction?**

**Direct Redox Reaction:**
A chemical reaction in which the transfer of electrons occurs directly between the reactants without any intermediate steps or agents.

Characteristics:
- Electron transfer occurs in a single step
- No intermediate compounds are formed
- The oxidizing and reducing agents interact directly

Examples:
1. $\mathrm{Zn} + \mathrm{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_4 + \mathrm{Cu}$
   - Zinc directly transfers electrons to copper ions
   - Zinc is oxidized from 0 to +2
   - Copper is reduced from +2 to 0

2. $2\mathrm{Na} + \mathrm{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{NaCl}$
   - Sodium directly transfers electrons to chlorine
   - No intermediate compounds are formed

**Indirect Redox Reaction:**
A chemical reaction in which the transfer of electrons occurs through intermediate steps or with the help of a third substance.

Characteristics:
- Electron transfer occurs in multiple steps
- Involves intermediate compounds or ions
- May require catalysts or other agents to facilitate the reaction

Examples:
1. In a galvanic cell, electrons flow through an external circuit:
   - Oxidation occurs at the anode: $\mathrm{Zn} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^-$
   - Reduction occurs at the cathode: $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}$
   - The electrons travel through an external wire rather than directly between reactants

2. In biological systems, electron transport chains involve multiple carriers:
   - Electrons are passed from one carrier to another
   - Each carrier is alternately reduced and oxidized
   - The final electron acceptor is often oxygen

**(b) Match the items in Column A with relevant items in Column B.**

| Column - A | Column - B |
|------------|------------|
| (a) Ions having +ve charge | (v) Cation |
| (b) Sum of oxidation no. of all atoms in a neutral molecule | (iv) 0 |
| (c) Oxidation No. of hydrogen ion | (iii) +1 |
| (d) Ion having -ve charge | (vi) Anion |

Explanation:
- (a) matches with (v): Ions with positive charge are called cations
- (b) matches with (iv): In any neutral molecule, the sum of all oxidation numbers must be zero
- (c) matches with (iii): The oxidation number of hydrogen in its ionic form (H⁺) is +1
- (d) matches with (vi): Ions with negative charge are called anions

**14. Balance the following redox reaction by ion electron method**

(a) $\begin{aligned} & \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}_2+\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{+3}+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \\ & \text { (aq) (aq) }\end{aligned}$

**Solution:**

(a) $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + \mathrm{Fe}^{+2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})$

Step 1: Identify the oxidation numbers.
- In $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$: H = +1, O = -1
- $\mathrm{Fe}^{+2}$ has oxidation number +2
- $\mathrm{Fe}^{+3}$ has oxidation number +3
- In $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$: H = +1, O = -2

Step 2: Identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
- Oxidation: $\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + \mathrm{e}^-$ (Fe is oxidized from +2 to +3)
- Reduction: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{e}^- \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{OH}^-$ (O is reduced from -1 to -2)

Step 3: Balance the half-reactions.
- Oxidation half-reaction is already balanced: $\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + \mathrm{e}^-$
- Reduction half-reaction: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{e}^- \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{OH}^-$

Step 4: Balance charge by adding H⁺ ions.
- Reduction: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{e}^- \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{OH}^-$
- Add 2H⁺: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{e}^- + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

Step 5: Multiply the half-reactions to equalize electrons.
- Oxidation: $2(\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + \mathrm{e}^-)$
- Reduction: $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{e}^- + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

Step 6: Add the half-reactions.
$2\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

Step 7: Check the balanced equation.
- Left side: 2Fe atoms, 2H atoms, 2O atoms
- Right side: 2Fe atoms, 4H atoms, 2O atoms

The equation is not balanced for H atoms. Since the reaction occurs in aqueous solution, we need to adjust:
$2\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

  Final balanced equation:
  $2\mathrm{Fe}^{+2} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}^+ \longrightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}^{+3} + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$

(b) $\mathrm{P}_{4(\mathrm{~s})}+\mathrm{OH}_{(\text {aq })}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{PO}_2^{-}(\mathrm{aq})$

**Solution:**

(b) $\mathrm{P}_{4(\mathrm{~s})}+\mathrm{OH}_{(\text {aq })}^{-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3(\mathrm{~g})+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{PO}_2^{-}(\mathrm{aq})$

Step 1: Identify the oxidation numbers.
- In $\mathrm{P}_{4}$: P = 0
- In $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$: O = -2, H = +1
- In $\mathrm{PH}_3$: P = -3, H = +1
- In $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^{-}$: P = +1, O = -2, H = +1

Step 2: Identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
- In this reaction, phosphorus atoms from the same $\mathrm{P}_{4}$ molecule undergo both oxidation and reduction (disproportionation).
- Oxidation: $\mathrm{P}^0 \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{+1}$ (P is oxidized from 0 to +1)
- Reduction: $\mathrm{P}^0 \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{-3}$ (P is reduced from 0 to -3)

Step 3: Balance the half-reactions.
- Oxidation half-reaction: $\mathrm{P}^0 \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{+1} + \mathrm{e}^-$
- Reduction half-reaction: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{-3}$

Step 4: Balance atoms and charges.
- Oxidation: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{e}^-$
- Reduction: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3 + 3\mathrm{OH}^-$

Step 5: Multiply the half-reactions to equalize electrons.
- Oxidation: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{e}^-$
- Reduction: $3(\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3 + 3\mathrm{OH}^-)$

Step 6: Add the half-reactions.
$\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- + 3\mathrm{P}^0 + 9\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{PH}_3 + 9\mathrm{OH}^-$

Step 7: Simplify the equation.
$4\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- + 9\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{PH}_3 + 9\mathrm{OH}^-$

$4\mathrm{P}^0 + 8\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + 3\mathrm{PH}_3 + 5\mathrm{OH}^-$

Step 8: Check the balanced equation.
- Left side: 4P atoms, 16H atoms, 8O atoms
- Right side: 4P atoms (1 in $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^-$ and 3 in $\mathrm{PH}_3$), 16H atoms (2 in $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^-$, 9 in $\mathrm{PH}_3$, and 5 in $\mathrm{OH}^-$), 8O atoms (2 in $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^-$ and 5 in $\mathrm{OH}^-$)

Final balanced equation:
$\mathrm{P}_{4} + 4\mathrm{OH}^- + 8\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + 3\mathrm{PH}_3 + 5\mathrm{OH}^-$

Simplifying further:
$\mathrm{P}_{4} + 8\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + 3\mathrm{PH}_3 + \mathrm{OH}^-$

Let me clarify Step 4 with more detail:

Step 4 (Revised): Balance atoms and charges in each half-reaction.

For the oxidation half-reaction:
- Starting with: $\mathrm{P}^0 \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{+1} + \mathrm{e}^-$
- We need to convert $\mathrm{P}^0$ to $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^-$
- Add $\mathrm{OH}^-$ to provide oxygen: $\mathrm{P}^0 + \mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{e}^-$
- Balance oxygen atoms (need 2 in product): $\mathrm{P}^0 + 2\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{e}^-$
- Balance hydrogen atoms (need 2 in product, have 2 from $\mathrm{OH}^-$): $\mathrm{P}^0 + 2\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{e}^-$
- Balance charge: Left side has -2 charge, right side has -1-1 = -2 charge ✓
- But we need to account for 3 electrons transferred (P goes from 0 to +3): $\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{e}^-$

For the reduction half-reaction:
- Starting with: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{P}^{-3}$
- We need to convert $\mathrm{P}^{-3}$ to $\mathrm{PH}_3$
- Add $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ as source of hydrogen: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3 + 3\mathrm{OH}^-$
- Balance hydrogen atoms: 6 on left (from water), need 3 in $\mathrm{PH}_3$ and 3 in $\mathrm{OH}^-$ ✓
- Balance oxygen atoms: 3 on left (from water), 3 on right (in $\mathrm{OH}^-$) ✓
- Balance charge: Left side has -3 charge, right side has 0-3 = -3 charge ✓

This clarifies how we arrived at the balanced half-reactions:
- Oxidation: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 4\mathrm{OH}^- \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{PO}_2^- + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} + 3\mathrm{e}^-$
- Reduction: $\mathrm{P}^0 + 3\mathrm{e}^- + 3\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{PH}_3 + 3\mathrm{OH}^-$
