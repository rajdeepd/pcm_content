### Long Answer Type Questions

17. (a) Write one example for each of decomposition reaction
    (i) Electricity
    (ii) Heat 
    (iii) Light

    **Answers:**.  
    (i) Electricity: $ 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Electricity}} 2\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.  
    (ii) Heat: $ \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.  
    (iii) Light: $ 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Light}} 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.   

    (b) Why can copper displace silver from a silver nitrate but silver cannot displace copper from copper sulphate solution?
        **Answer:** Copper is more reactive than silver, so it can displace silver from its salt solution. However, silver is less reactive than copper, so it cannot displace copper.

18. Compound $A$ when dissolved in water gives compound $B$ and liberates heat. Compound $A$ is used in whitewashing. Compound $B$ reacts with $\mathrm{CO}_2$ to form a white precipitate of compound $C$. Identify compounds $A, B$ and $C$. Also write the equations involved.

    **Answers:**
    (i) $ A = \mathrm{CaO} $ (Quick Lime)
    (ii) $ B = \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2 $ (Slaked Lime)
    (iii) $ C = \mathrm{CaCO}_3 $ (Calcium Carbonate)

    **Equations:**
    $ \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \text{Heat} $
    $ \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) $

19. When CaO is added to water taken in a beaker, rise in temperature is observed. However, when $\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_2$ is mixed with $\mathrm{NH}_4 \mathrm{Cl}$, a fall in temperature is observed. Why?

    **Answer:**
    The reaction between $\mathrm{CaO}$ and water is **exothermic**, meaning heat is released, causing a rise in temperature.
    The reaction between $\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_2$ and $\mathrm{NH}_4 \mathrm{Cl}$ is **endothermic**, meaning heat is absorbed from the surroundings, causing a fall in temperature.
