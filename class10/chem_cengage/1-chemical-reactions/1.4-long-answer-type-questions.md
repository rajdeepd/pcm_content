### Long Answer Type Questions

17. (a) Write one example for each of decomposition reaction
    (i) Electricity
    (ii) Heat 
    (iii) Light

    **Answers:**.  
    (i) Electricity: $ 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Electricity}} 2\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.  
    (ii) Heat: $ \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.  
    (iii) Light: $ 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Light}} 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) $.   

    (b) Why can copper displace silver from a silver nitrate but silver cannot displace copper from copper sulphate solution?
        **Answer:** Copper is more reactive than silver, so it can displace silver from its salt solution. However, silver is less reactive than copper, so it cannot displace copper.

18. Compound $A$ when dissolved in water gives compound $B$ and liberates heat. Compound $A$ is used in whitewashing. Compound $B$ reacts with $\mathrm{CO}_2$ to form a white precipitate of compound $C$. Identify compounds $A, B$ and $C$. Also write the equations involved.

    **Answers:**
    (i) $ A = \mathrm{CaO} $ (Quick Lime)
    (ii) $ B = \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2 $ (Slaked Lime)
    (iii) $ C = \mathrm{CaCO}_3 $ (Calcium Carbonate)

    **Equations:**
    $ \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \text{Heat} $
    $ \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) $

19. When CaO is added to water taken in a beaker, rise in temperature is observed. However, when $\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_2$ is mixed with $\mathrm{NH}_4 \mathrm{Cl}$, a fall in temperature is observed. Why?

    **Answer:**
    The reaction between $\mathrm{CaO}$ and water is **exothermic**, meaning heat is released, causing a rise in temperature.
    The reaction between $\mathrm{Ba}(\mathrm{OH})_2$ and $\mathrm{NH}_4 \mathrm{Cl}$ is **endothermic**, meaning heat is absorbed from the surroundings, causing a fall in temperature.

### HOTS Questions

20. The gases hydrogen and chlorine do not react with each other, even if they are kept together for a long time. However, in the presence of sunlight, they readily combine. Why does this happen?

    **Answer:**
    Sunlight provides energy to the gases hydrogen and chlorine, which causes them to react with each other.
We know that in chemical reactions, energy is needed to break the bonds present in the reacting molecules so that they may combine to form the products. In the present case, sun light is the source of energy in the form of photons. The energy made available helps in breaking the bonds present in the reactant molecules and the chemical reaction leading to hydrogen chloride gas takes place
21. When a water insoluble substance $X$ reacts with dilute $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4$, a colourless and odourless gas is accompanied by brisk effervescence.
    When the gas was passed through water, the solution obtained turned blue litmus red. On bubbling the gas through lime water, it initially became milky, and the milkiness disappeared when the gas passed in excess. Identify the substance $X$ and write the chemical equations of the reactions involved.]

22. (a) Based on the reactions given below, arrange the metals involved in these reactions in decreasing order of reactivity. Give a suitable explanation.
    (i) $\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_4+\mathrm{Cu}$
    (ii) $\mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_3 \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NO}_3\right)_2+2 \mathrm{Ag}$
    (iii) $\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{FeSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_4+\mathrm{Fe}$
    (iv) $\mathrm{Fe}+\mathrm{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{FeSO}_4+\mathrm{Cu}$

    (b) What is the nature of the reactions?
