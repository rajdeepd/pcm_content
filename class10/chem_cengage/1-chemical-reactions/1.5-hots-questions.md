### HOTS Questions

20. The gases hydrogen and chlorine do not react with each other, even if they are kept together for a long time. However, in the presence of sunlight, they readily combine. Why does this happen?

    **Answer:**
    Sunlight provides energy to the gases hydrogen and chlorine, which causes them to react with each other.
We know that in chemical reactions, energy is needed to break the bonds present in the reacting molecules so that they may combine to form the products. In the present case, sun light is the source of energy in the form of photons. The energy made available helps in breaking the bonds present in the reactant molecules and the chemical reaction leading to hydrogen chloride gas takes place
21. When a water insoluble substance $X$ reacts with dilute $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4$, a colourless and odourless gas is accompanied by brisk effervescence.
    When the gas was passed through water, the solution obtained turned blue litmus red. On bubbling the gas through lime water, it initially became milky, and the milkiness disappeared when the gas passed in excess. Identify the substance $X$ and write the chemical equations of the reactions involved.

    **Answer:**
    
    **Identification:**
    - The gas is **$\mathrm{CO}_2$ (Carbon dioxide)** - colourless, odourless, forms acidic solution in water
    - Substance $X$ is **$\mathrm{CaCO}_3$ (Calcium carbonate)** - water insoluble carbonate that produces $\mathrm{CO}_2$ with acids
    
    **Chemical Equations:**
    
    (i) Reaction of substance X with dilute sulfuric acid:
    $$\mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CaSO}_4(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g})$$
    
    (ii) Gas passed through water (turns blue litmus red):
    $$\mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{CO}_3(\mathrm{aq})$$
    
    (iii) Gas bubbled through lime water (becomes milky):
    $$\mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{Ca(OH)}_2(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l})$$
    
    (iv) Excess gas makes milkiness disappear:
    $$\mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca(HCO_3)}_2(\mathrm{aq})$$

22. (a) Based on the reactions given below, arrange the metals involved in these reactions in decreasing order of reactivity. Give a suitable explanation.   
    (i) $\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_4+\mathrm{Cu}$.  
    (ii) $\mathrm{Cu}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_3 \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NO}_3\right)_2+2 \mathrm{Ag}$.  
    (iii) $\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{FeSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnSO}_4+\mathrm{Fe}$.  
    (iv) $\mathrm{Fe}+\mathrm{CuSO}_4 \rightarrow \mathrm{FeSO}_4+\mathrm{Cu}$.  

    (b) What is the nature of the reactions? 

    **Answer:**
    
    (a) **Decreasing order of reactivity: Zn > Fe > Cu > Ag**
    
    **Explanation:**
    From the given reactions, we can determine the reactivity order:
    
    - Reaction (i): Zn displaces Cu from CuSO₄ → **Zn > Cu**
    - Reaction (ii): Cu displaces Ag from AgNO₃ → **Cu > Ag**  
    - Reaction (iii): Zn displaces Fe from FeSO₄ → **Zn > Fe**
    - Reaction (iv): Fe displaces Cu from CuSO₄ → **Fe > Cu**
    
    Combining these relationships: **Zn > Fe > Cu > Ag**
    
    A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution.
    
    (b) **Nature of reactions:** These are **single displacement reactions** (or substitution reactions) where a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution.
