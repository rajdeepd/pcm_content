## Detailed Notes for Extraction

### 1. Bonding in Carbon (Pages 3-7)
- Focus on electron dot structures for H2, O2, N2, Cl2, CH4, CO2.
- Explain why carbon forms covalent bonds.

### 2. Allotropes (Pages 10-12)
- Detailed structures of Diamond and Graphite.
- Comparison table of properties.
- Brief mention of C-60 (Buckminsterfullerene).

### 3. Nomenclature (Pages 23-35)
- This is a large section. Extract rules for alkanes, alkenes, alkynes.
- Extract functional group rules: alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids.
- Include the many worked examples provided in the source.

### 4. Chemical Properties (Pages 36-45)
- Reactions: Combustion, Oxidation, Addition (Hydrogenation), Substitution.
- Activities: Include the steps and observations from the activity boxes.

### 5. Soaps and Detergents (Pages 56-59)
- Micelle formation (diagram is crucial).
- Saponification reaction.
- Difference between soaps and detergents.

### 6. Exercises
- The current `1-veryshort-answers.md`, `2-short-answers.md`, and `3-long-answers.md` files likely correspond to exercise sections found throughout or at the end of the chapter. They should be reviewed against the questions on the later pages.
