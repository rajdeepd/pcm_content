1. **Answer: (3)**
   **Explanation:** $C_4H_6$ is an alkyne (Butyne) and $C_6H_{12}$ can be an alkene (Hexene) or a cycloalkane (Cyclohexane). Both contain multiple bonds or rings that make them unsaturated compared to alkanes.

2. **Answer: (3)**
   **Explanation:** Benzene ($C_6H_6$) is a cyclic hydrocarbon that contains three carbon-carbon single bonds and three carbon-carbon double bonds in alternating positions.

3. **Answer: (2)**
   **Explanation:** Ethane ($C_2H_6$) has the structure $CH_3—CH_3$. Each carbon is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, making a total of 6 C-H bonds.

4. **Answer: (1)**
   **Explanation:** Chloroform ($CHCl_3$) is a covalent compound. $CaCO_3$, $NaHCO_3$, and $Ca_2C$ are ionic compounds containing ions like $Ca^{2+}$, $CO_3^{2-}$, $Na^+$, $HCO_3^-$, etc.

5. **Answer: (2)**
   **Explanation:** Carbon has 4 valence electrons. By sharing 4 more electrons through covalent bonding, it completes its octet (8 valence electrons) and attains the stable electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, **Neon** (2, 8).

6. **Answer: (2)**
   **Explanation:**
   - Propane ($C_3H_8$) has 8 hydrogens.
   - Propyne ($C_3H_4$) has 4 hydrogens. Difference $= 8 - 4 = 4$.
   - Propene ($C_3H_6$) has 6 hydrogens. Difference $= 8 - 6 = 2$.
   - Ratio of differences $= 4 : 2 = \mathbf{2:1}$.

7. **Answer: (3)**
   **Explanation:** Alkenes are hydrocarbons containing at least one double bond. They are unsaturated and more reactive than alkanes. Ethene, the simplest alkene, is used in the production of plastics like polyethylene.

8. **Answer: (2)**
   **Explanation:**
   - (A) $C_3H_4$ is **Propyne** (iii), which is an **Organic compound** (ii).
   - (B) $C_3H_6$ is **Cyclopropane** (iv), which is an **Organic compound** (ii).
   - (C) Alum is an **Inorganic compound** (i).
   - (D) Alcohol is an **Organic compound** (ii).
   The combination A – (ii), (iii); B – (ii), (iv); C – (i); D – (ii) matches option (2).

9. **Crossword Solutions:**
   - **Across 3:** **UNSATURATED** (Cyclic compounds with double bonds)
   - **Across 5:** **ALIPHATIC** (Open chain carbon compounds)
   - **Down 2:** **HYDROCARBONS** (Compounds of C and H)
   - **Down 4:** **SATURATED** (Compounds with only single bonds)
