# 10. SOME IMPORTANT CARBON COMPOUNDS

Many carbon compounds are invaluable to us, but here we shall study the properties of two commercially important compounds: ethanol and ethanoic acid.

## 10.1 Ethanol (Ethyl Alcohol, $C_2H_5OH$)

*   Ethanol is the second member of the homologous series of alcohols.
*   Its common name is ethyl alcohol.
*   It has no action on litmus and is hence, neutral in nature.

### Physical Properties
(i) Pure ethanol is a colourless liquid with a pleasant smell and a burning taste.
(ii) It is a volatile liquid with a boiling point of 78.1°C, and a freezing point of –114°C.
(iii) Ethanol is miscible with water in all proportions, due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes drunkenness.

{: .note }
> **INSIGHTS**
> * Long term consumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.
> * Pure ethanol is known as **absolute alcohol** and intake of even a small quantity of pure ethanol can be lethal.

### Chemical Properties

(i) **Combustion (or burning):** Ethanol is a highly inflammable liquid that readily burns in the air with a blue flame to form water vapour and carbon dioxide with a lot of heat.
    $$C_2H_5OH(l) + 3O_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Combustion}} 2CO_2(g) + 3H_2O(g) + \text{Heat}$$

(ii) **Reaction with sodium metal:** Ethanol reacts with sodium metal to produce sodium ethoxide and hydrogen gas. This reaction is used as a test for ethanol in laboratory.
    $$2C_2H_5OH(l) + 2Na(s) \rightarrow 2C_2H_5ONa(l) + H_2(g)$$
    *(Ethanol + Sodium metal $\rightarrow$ Sodium ethoxide + Hydrogen gas)*

---

{: .activity }
> **ACTIVITY 2**
> **Aim:** To study the reaction of ethanol with sodium metal.
> **Observation:** The gas evolved in test tube causes effervescence and burns with a popping sound.
> **Conclusion:** Ethanol reacts with sodium metal with the evolution of hydrogen gas.

---

(iii) **Reaction with conc. sulphuric acid (Dehydration):** Ethanol when heated with an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at 443 K, gets dehydrated to give ethene.
    $$C_2H_5OH(l) + H_2SO_4(\text{conc.}) \xrightarrow{443 K} H_2C=CH_2(g) + H_2O(l)$$
    *(Ethanol $\rightarrow$ Ethene)*
    *Note: The concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating agent that removes water from ethanol.*

(iv) **Oxidation:** Oxidation of ethanol with oxidizing agents (e.g., alkaline $KMnO_4$ and acidified $K_2Cr_2O_7$) leads to the formation of ethanoic acid.
    $$CH_3CH_2OH + O_2 \xrightarrow{KMnO_4} CH_3COOH + H_2O$$

### Uses
(i) It is used as a solvent for paints, varnishes, dyes, cosmetics, perfumes, soaps and synthetic rubber, etc.
(ii) Ethanol is used in cough syrups, digestive syrups and tonics.
(iii) It is used as an antiseptic to sterilize wounds and syringes in hospitals.
(iv) A mixture of ethanol and water has a lower freezing point than water; this mixture is known as **antifreeze** and is used in radiators of vehicles in cold countries and at hill stations.
(v) Ethanol is a major component of alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine and whisky.
(vi) A mixture of 80% petrol and 20% alcohol is called **power alcohol**. It is used as a fuel in cars and aeroplanes.

{: .note }
> **INSIGHTS**
> **Alcohol as fuel:** Sugarcane plants are among the most efficient at converting sunlight into chemical energy. The juice extracted from sugarcane can be used to produce molasses, which can then be fermented to yield ethanol (alcohol). In some countries, ethanol is now added to petrol as it serves as a cleaner fuel, producing only carbon dioxide and water when burned in adequate air (oxygen).

## 10.2 Ethanoic Acid (Acetic Acid, $CH_3COOH$)

*   Ethanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and belongs to the homologous series of carboxylic acids.
*   Its chemical formula is $CH_3COOH$.
*   It is a weak acid and turns blue litmus red.

### Physical Properties
(i) At ordinary temperature, ethanoic acid is a colourless liquid with a strong pungent smell and sour taste.
(ii) Its boiling point is 391 K and its density at 273 K is 1.08 g/cm$^3$ (heavier than water).
(iii) It is miscible with water due to the formation of hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
(iv) On cooling at 289.6 K, it turns into ice-like crystals and is hence named as **glacial acetic acid**.
(v) It dissolves sulphur, iodine and many other organic compounds.
(vi) It dimerizes when dissolved in solution of benzene.

### Chemical Properties

(i) **Reaction with alcohols (Esterification reaction):** Ethanoic acid reacts with ethanol in the presence of conc. $H_2SO_4$ to form ethyl ethanoate which is an ester. Esters are sweet-smelling substances which are used for making perfumes and as flavouring agents.
    $$CH_3COOH(l) + C_2H_5OH(l) \xrightarrow{\text{Conc. } H_2SO_4, \text{ heat}} CH_3COOC_2H_5(l) + H_2O(l)$$
    *The reaction of carboxylic acid with an alcohol to form an ester is called "esterification reaction".*

{: .note }
> **NOTE**
> * Ester can be hydrolyzed in the presence of an acid or a base to give back the parent carboxylic acid and the alcohol. For example,
>   (a) Ethyl ethanoate on acid hydrolysis gives ethanoic acid and ethanol.
>   (b) Hydrolysis of an ester in the presence of a base (alkali) is called **saponification reaction**.
>   $$CH_3COOC_2H_5(l) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow CH_3COONa + C_2H_5OH$$
>   *(Ethyl ethanoate + Sodium Hydroxide $\rightarrow$ Sodium ethanoate + Ethanol)*
> * Alkaline hydrolysis of higher esters is used in the manufacture of soaps.

(ii) **Reaction with sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate:** Ethanoic acid decomposes sodium hydrogen carbonate and sodium carbonate with a rapid evolution of carbon dioxide gas.
    $$NaHCO_3(aq) + CH_3COOH(aq) \rightarrow CH_3COONa(aq) + H_2O(l) + CO_2(g)$$
    $$Na_2CO_3(aq) + 2CH_3COOH(aq) \rightarrow 2CH_3COONa(aq) + H_2O(l) + CO_2(g)$$

{: .activity }
> **ACTIVITY 3**
> **Aim:** To demonstrate that sodium carbonate reacts with ethanoic acid to evolve carbon dioxide gas.
> **Observation:** Brisk effervescence is observed. When evolved gas is passed through lime water, it turns milky.
> **Conclusion:** Sodium carbonate reacts with ethanoic acid to give sodium ethanoate, water and carbon dioxide. $Ca(OH)_2 + CO_2 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + H_2O$ (Milkiness).

---

(iii) **Reduction:** Reduction of ethanoic acid with reducing agents such as $LiAlH_4$, leads to the formation of ethanol.
    $$CH_3COOH \xrightarrow{LiAlH_4, \text{ Reduction}} CH_3CH_2OH$$

### Uses
(i) Ethanoic acid is used in the manufacture of various dyes, perfumes and rayon.
(ii) It is used for making vinegar.
(iii) Its 5% solution is bactericidal (destroys bacteria).
(iv) It is used for the coagulation of the latex.
