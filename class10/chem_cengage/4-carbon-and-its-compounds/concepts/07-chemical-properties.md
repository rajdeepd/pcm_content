# 9. Chemical Properties of Carbon Compounds

Carbon compounds generally show the following four chemical reactions:
1.  **Combustion**
2.  **Oxidation**
3.  **Addition**
4.  **Substitution**

## 9.1 Combustion Reaction

Combustion is the process of the complete burning of a substance in the presence of oxygen along with the liberation of a large amount of heat and light. It can be considered rapid and complete oxidation.

### Combustion of some common substances:
(i) **Combustion of carbon:** Carbon (or charcoal) burns in air or oxygen to give $CO_2$ along with heat and light.
    $$C(s) + O_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Combustion}} CO_2(g) + \text{Heat} + \text{light}$$

(ii) **Combustion of carbon compounds:** Most of the compounds of carbon burn to produce carbon dioxide ($CO_2$), water ($H_2O$) and heat and light.
    *   **Methane:** $CH_4(g) + O_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Combustion}} CO_2(g) + H_2O(g) + \text{Heat} + \text{light}$
    *   **Ethanol:** $C_2H_5OH(l) + 3O_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{burn}} 2CO_2(g) + 3H_2O(g) + \text{Heat} + \text{light}$

> **NOTE**
> Natural gas and biogas contain methane. So, burning of natural gas and biogas are also combustion reactions.
> $$C_4H_{10}(g) + \frac{13}{2}O_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Combustion}} 4CO_2(g) + 5H_2O(g) + \text{Heat} + \text{Light}$$

{: .activity }
> **ACTIVITY 1**
> **Aim:** To observe and compare the combustion characteristics of different carbon compounds
> **Observation:**
> (i) **Naphthalene** burns with a sooty, yellowish flame. Lots of smoke and black soot deposition.
> (ii) **Camphor** burns with a bright, almost smokeless flame. Minimal smoke and soot.
> (iii) **Alcohol** burns with a clean, bluish flame. No smoke or soot deposition.
> **Conclusion:**
> * Saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., alcohol) generally give a clean flame.
> * Unsaturated carbon compounds (e.g., naphthalene) give a yellow flame with black smoke due to unburnt carbon particles.

> **INSIGHTS**
> * Gas/kerosene stoves have air inlets to ensure an oxygen-rich mixture for a clean blue flame. If inlets are blocked, a sooty flame is produced.
> * Fuels like coal and petroleum contain nitrogen and sulphur, which form polluting oxides upon combustion.

## 9.2 Oxidation Reaction

The addition of oxygen or the removal of hydrogen is called **oxidation**, and the substances that are capable of adding oxygen to other substances are called **oxidizing agents**.

*   **Carbon to Carbon monoxide/dioxide:**
    $$2C(s) + O_2(g) \text{ (limited)} \rightarrow 2CO(g)$$
    $$C(s) + O_2(g) \text{ (excess)} \rightarrow CO_2(g)$$

*   **Oxidation of Alcohols:**
    (i) Alcohols on oxidation with certain oxidizing agents such as chromic anhydride in acetic acid, yield corresponding **aldehydes**.
    $$CH_3CH_2OH(l) + [O] \xrightarrow{CrO_3 \text{ in } CH_3COOH} CH_3CHO(l) + H_2O(l)$$
    (ii) On oxidation with **alkaline potassium permanganate** (or acidified potassium dichromate), the corresponding **carboxylic acid** is formed.
    $$CH_3CH_2OH(l) + 2[O] \xrightarrow{\text{Alkaline } KMnO_4, \text{ Heat}} CH_3COOH(l) + H_2O(l)$$

## 9.3 Addition Reaction

Reactions in which unsaturated hydrocarbons react with a molecule like $H_2, X_2, H_2O$, etc., to form saturated compounds are called **addition reactions**.

*   **Hydrogenation:** Addition of hydrogen to an unsaturated carbon compound is called hydrogenation reaction. It requires catalysts like nickel (Ni) or palladium (Pd).
    (i) **Addition to ethene:** $H_2C=CH_2 + H_2(g) \xrightarrow{Ni, 250^\circ C} CH_3-CH_3$ (Ethane)
    (ii) **Addition to ethyne:** $HC \equiv CH + H_2(g) \xrightarrow{Ni, \text{ Heat}} H_2C=CH_2 \xrightarrow{H_2, Ni, \text{ Heat}} CH_3-CH_3$

### Industrial Importance of Hydrogenation Reactions
Certain vegetable oils (like groundnut oil, cotton seed oil) contain double bonds ($C=C$) and are liquids. They undergo hydrogenation to form saturated products called **Vanaspati ghee**, which is semi-solid at room temperature.
$$\text{Vegetable oils (Unsaturated)} + H_2 \xrightarrow{Ni, \text{ Heat}} \text{Vanaspati Ghee (Saturated)}$$

> **INSIGHTS**
> **Test for Unsaturation in Carbon Compounds:**
> (i) **Baeyer's test:** Alkaline $KMnO_4$ (pink) is added. Decolourization (disappearance of pink colour) indicates unsaturation.
> (ii) **Bromine test:** Bromine water (orange-red) is added. Decolourization indicates unsaturation.

## 9.4 Substitution Reactions

The reactions in which one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon are replaced by some other atoms or groups are called **substitution reactions**. Alkanes generally undergo substitution reactions because they are saturated and do not undergo addition.

*   **Chlorination of Methane:** In the presence of sunlight, methane reacts with chlorine to give a series of substituted products. This is a **photochemical reaction**.
    $$CH_4(g) + Cl_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}} CH_3Cl(g) + HCl(g)$$ (Chloromethane)
    $$CH_3Cl(g) + Cl_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}} CH_2Cl_2(g) + HCl(g)$$ (Dichloromethane)
    $$CH_2Cl_2(g) + Cl_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}} CHCl_3(g) + HCl(g)$$ (Trichloromethane / Chloroform)
    $$CHCl_3(g) + Cl_2(g) \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}} CCl_4(l) + HCl(g)$$ (Tetrachloromethane)
