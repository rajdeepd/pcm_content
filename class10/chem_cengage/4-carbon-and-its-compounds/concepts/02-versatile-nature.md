# 3. Versatile Nature of Carbon

The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be in millions. This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. The existence of such a large number of carbon compounds is due to the following characteristics features of carbon:

### (i) Catenation
The property of forming bonds with atoms of the same element is called **catenation**. Carbon has the maximum tendency for catenation in the periodic table. This is due to the following two reasons:
(a) Carbon cannot donate or gain four electrons required to attain inert gas configuration and therefore, show tendency to form covalent bonds.
(b) Due to its small size, shared electron pairs are strongly held by both nuclei which results in formation of strong covalent bonds. The carbon–carbon bond thus formed is very strong and stable.

*   No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. For example, silicon forms compounds with hydrogen having chains made up of seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive.
*   When two or more carbon atoms combine with one another, they form different types of chains such as:

#### (a) Straight chains
```
    |   |   |
— C — C — C —
    |   |   |
```
*Straight chain*

#### (b) Branched chains
```
    |   |   |   |   |
— C — C — C — C — C —
    |   |   |   |   |
            |
          — C —
            |
```
*Branched chain*

#### (c) Closed chain or ring chains
```
      C
    /   \
   C     C
   |     |
   C     C
    \   /
      C
```
*Closed chain (Minimum 3C required in closed chain structure)*

### (ii) Tetravalency of carbon
*   The atomic number of carbon is 6, and hence its electronic configuration is 2, 4. It has four electrons in the outermost shell and therefore, its valency is four (tetravalency). Thus, carbon forms four covalent bonds in its compounds.
*   Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties. These properties depend upon the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.

**Formation of Methane ($CH_4$):**
$$ \cdot\text{C}\cdot + 4\text{H}\cdot \rightarrow \text{H}:\overset{\text{H}}{\underset{\text{H}}{\text{C}}}:\text{H} $$
*(Carbon forms four covalent bonds; Hydrogen forms one covalent bond each)*

### (iii) Tendency to form multiple bonds
*   Due to its small size and presence of four valence electrons, carbon can easily form double or triple bonds (called **multiple bonds**) with itself and with the atoms of other elements such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, etc.

**Examples of bonds:**

*   **Single Bond:**
    ```
        H
        |
    H — C — H
        |
        H
    ```
*   **Double Bond:**
    $H_2C=CH_2$, $O=C=O$
*   **Triple Bond:**
    $H—C \equiv C—H$, $—C \equiv N$

## TEST YOURSELF

1. Draw the electron dot structure of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$).
2. Draw the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which is made up of eight atoms of sulphur.
   **Hint:** The eight atoms of sulphur are joined together in the form of a ring.
