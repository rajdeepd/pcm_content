# 11. SOAPS AND DETERGENTS

Any substance that shows cleansing action in water is called a detergent. Detergents are of two types: soapy and non-soapy. Detergents with a soapy touch are called **soaps** and detergents with a non-soapy touch are called 'synthetic detergents' or just '**detergents**'.

## 11.1 Soaps

*   Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of a long chain carboxylic acids (fatty acids), which have cleansing action in water.
*   Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is **hydrophilic**, i.e., it interacts with water, while the other end is **hydrophobic**, i.e., it interacts with hydrocarbons.
*   The soap molecule is said to have a **tadpole structure**.
*   Chemically, soaps are salts of a strong base (like sodium hydroxide) and a weak acid (a carboxylic acid). Therefore, they show basic nature in aqueous solution and turn red litmus paper blue.

**Examples of soaps:**
(i) **Sodium stearate ($C_{17}H_{35}COO^-Na^+$):** Sodium stearate is the sodium salt of a long-chain saturated fatty acid called stearic acid, $C_{17}H_{35}COOH$. It has a long alkyl group $C_{17}H_{35}$ and an ionic carboxylate group $COO^-Na^+$.
(ii) **Sodium palmitate ($C_{15}H_{31}COO^-Na^+$):** Sodium palmitate is the sodium salt of a long-chain saturated fatty acid called palmitic acid, $C_{15}H_{31}COOH$.

### Manufacture of Soap
*   Soaps are prepared by heating animal fat or vegetable oil with a concentrated sodium hydroxide solution.
*   When heated with $NaOH$ solution, fats and oils (obtained from animals and plants) split to form sodium salts of higher fatty acids (called soap) and glycerol. The reaction is called **saponification**.
    $$\text{Fat or Oil (An ester)} + \text{Sodium hydroxide (An alkali)} \rightarrow \text{Soap (Sodium salt of fatty acid)} + \text{Glycerol (An alcohol)}$$
*   During saponification, common salt is added to the mixture to precipitate out all the soap from the aqueous solution as it is more soluble in water as compared to soap. In the absence of common salt, some soap remains dissolved in the mixture which is not precipitated on heating.

## Structure and Cleansing Action of Soap

*   A soap molecule is made up of two parts: a long hydrocarbon part (tail) and a short ionic part (head) containing the $-COO^-Na^+$ group.
*   The long hydrocarbon chain is hydrophobic and insoluble in water but soluble in oil and grease. The ionic portion of the soap molecule is hydrophilic due to its polar nature and is soluble in water but insoluble in oil and grease.
*   Hydrocarbon part of the soap molecule attaches with oil and grease particles present on dirty clothes. On the other hand, the short hydrophilic part of the soap molecule attaches to water particles in which the soap is dissolved and the dirty cloth is dipped.
*   Thus, soap molecules form a spherical structure called **micelle** where one end is towards the oil droplet and the other end, which is ionic, projects outside.

### Cleansing effect of soap
*   When dissolved in water, soap molecules ionize and $Na^+$ ions are removed from the head. Due to this reason, the overall charge on the surface of micelles is negative.
*   Due to the negative charge on the outer surface, micelles repel each other and stabilize to produce a colloidal solution. Thus, when we agitate a dirty soap solution, the oily and greasy particles present on the cloth surface are entrapped by soap micelles which get dispersed in water. This results in a dirty appearance of the soap solution.
*   Micelles attached to cloth (suspended in water present in cloth) are removed by rinsing the cloth in clean water a number of times.
*   A soap solution appears cloudy because the soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.
*   When soap is dissolved in organic solvents like ethanol or chloroform, micelles are not formed because the long hydrocarbon chain is soluble in the organic solvents.

## Limitations of Soap

The major limitation of soap is that it is not suitable for washing clothes with hard water. It is because of two reasons:
(i) Soap does not lather easily with hard water, as a large amount of soap is wasted in reacting with ions present in hard water to form an insoluble curdy precipitate called **scum**, before it is used for washing.
(ii) The scum formed, sticks to the clothes and interferes with the cleansing ability of soap. This makes the cleaning of clothes difficult.
*   To overcome this limitation, detergents are used in place of soaps.

## 11.2 Detergents

*   A detergent is the sodium salt of a long chain benzene sulphonic acid or sodium salt of a long-chain alkyl hydrogen sulphate, which has cleansing action in water. A detergent has a large non-ionic hydrocarbon group and an ionic group like sulphonate group, $SO_3^-Na^+$, or the sulphate group $SO_4^-Na^+$. For example, sodium lauryl sulphate ($C_{12}H_{25}-O-SO_3Na$).
*   Detergents are called 'soap-less soaps' because, though they act like soaps in having cleansing properties, they do not have the usual soapy touch of soaps.
*   They are better cleansing agents than soap because they do not give insoluble calcium or magnesium salts with hard water, and therefore can be used for washing clothes even with hard water.
*   The structure and cleansing action of a detergent are similar to those of soaps. A detergent molecule also consists of two parts: a long hydrocarbon chain that is water-repelling (hydrophobic), and a short ionic part that is water-attracting (hydrophilic).
*   Detergents are prepared from long chain hydrocarbons obtained during the refining of petroleum oil.
*   They are generally used to make washing powders and shampoos.

### Differences between Soaps and Detergents

| S.No. | Soaps | Detergents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of the long-chain carboxylic acids (fatty acids). The ionic group in soaps is $-COO^-Na^+$. | Detergents are the sodium salts of long-chain benzene sulphonic acids or long-chain alkyl hydrogen sulphates. The ionic group in a detergent is $-SO_3^-Na^+$ or $-SO_4^-Na^+$. |
| 2 | They are not suitable for washing with hard water as they form scum. | These can be used for washing even with hard water. |
| 3 | Soaps are biodegradable (can be decomposed by microorganisms like bacteria). | Some of the detergents are non-biodegradable and cause water pollution. |
| 4 | Soaps have relatively weak cleansing action. | Detergents have a strong cleansing action. |

## Example 15
List the main advantages of synthetic detergents.
**Solution:** (i) Do not react with ions in hard water (no scum). (ii) Even lather in sea water or acidic water. (iii) Dissolve faster than soaps.

## Example 16
Do detergents cause water pollution?
**Solution:** Yes, detergents are highly branched hydrocarbons, which when used cannot be degraded with bacteria easily. Due to long-chain hydrocarbons, they undergo slow degradation that leads to their accumulation and this causes water pollution.
