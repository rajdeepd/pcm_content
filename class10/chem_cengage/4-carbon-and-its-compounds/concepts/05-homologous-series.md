# 6.4 Functional Groups

In organic chemistry, **functional groups** (or moieties) are specific groups of atoms within molecules that are responsible for the characteristic chemical reactions of those molecules. For example, the chemical behaviour of ethyl alcohol ($C_2H_5OH$) and ethyl amine ($C_2H_5NH_2$) are altogether different although they contain the same alkyl group.

*   Functional groups are attached to the carbon backbone of organic molecules through their valency by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms. They determine the characteristics and chemical reactivity of molecules.
*   Functional groups are far less stable than the carbon backbone and are more likely to participate in chemical reactions.
*   Organic compounds having the same functional group behave similarly and form a class of compounds.

**Important Functional Groups and the Corresponding Classes of Organic Compounds:**

| S.No. | Formula | Functional Group Name | Class of compounds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | –X (–F, Cl, –Br, –I) | Halo (fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo) | Alkyl halides or halogen compounds |
| 2. | –OH | Hydroxy | Alcohols |
| 3. | –OR | Alkoxy | Ethers |
| 4. | –SH | Mercapto | Thioalcohols, mercaptans or thiols |
| 5. | –SR | | Thioethers or sulphides |
| 6. | –CHO | Aldehydic | Aldehydes |
| 7. | –CO– | Ketonic | Ketones |
| 8. | –COOH | Carboxyl | Carboxylic acids |
| 9. | –COOR | Ester | Esters |
| 10. | –COX (X = Cl, Br or I) | Acyl halide | Acid halides or Acyl halides |
| 11. | –CONH$_2$ | Amide | Amides or acid amides |
| 12. | –COOCO– | Anhydride | Acid anhydrides |
| 13. | –NH$_2$ | Amino | Amines |
| 14. | –NH– | Imino | Imines |
| 15. | –C $\equiv$ N | Cyano | Cyanides or Nitriles |
| 16. | –N $\equiv$ C | Isocyano | Isocyanides or Isonitriles |

| 19. | –N = N– | Azo | Azo compounds |
| 20. | –SO$_2$ – OH | Sulphonic acid | Sulphonic acids |

## 6.5 Homologous Series

A series of organic compounds having similar functional groups and similar chemical properties in which the successive members differ in their molecular formula by the **–CH$_2$** group is called **homologous series**. The different members of the series are called **homologues**.

**Important features of homologous series are:**
(i) All the members of a homologous series can be described by a common general formula. For example, all alkanes can be described by the general formula $C_nH_{2n+2}$ where $n$ may have the values 1, 2, 3, .... etc.
(ii) Two successive members differ by a common difference of **–CH$_2$** group.
(iii) Molecular masses of the two adjacent homologues differ by 14 mass units, because the molecular mass of the –CH$_2$ group is $12 + 2 = 14$.
(iv) All the members of a homologous series show similar chemical properties. For example, substitution reaction is shown by all alkanes.
(v) All the members of a homologous series show a gradation in physical properties as molecular mass increases. For example, m.pt. and b.pt. increases with increase in molecular mass.
(vi) All the members of the series can be prepared by similar methods known as the general method of preparation.

**Some Members of Alkane, Alkene and Alkyne Homologous Series:**

| Alkane ($C_nH_{2n+2}$) | Alkene ($C_nH_{2n}$) | Alkyne ($C_nH_{2n-2}$) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Name**: Methane, **Formula**: $CH_4$ | — | — |
| **Name**: Ethane, **Formula**: $C_2H_6$ | **Name**: Ethene, **Formula**: $C_2H_4$ | **Name**: Ethyne, **Formula**: $C_2H_2$ |
| **Name**: Propane, **Formula**: $C_3H_8$ | **Name**: Propene, **Formula**: $C_3H_6$ | **Name**: Propyne, **Formula**: $C_3H_4$ |
| **Name**: Butane, **Formula**: $C_4H_{10}$ | **Name**: Butene, **Formula**: $C_4H_8$ | **Name**: Butyne, **Formula**: $C_4H_6$ |
| **Name**: Pentane, **Formula**: $C_5H_{12}$ | **Name**: Pentene, **Formula**: $C_5H_{10}$ | **Name**: Pentyne, **Formula**: $C_5H_8$ |
| **Name**: Hexane, **Formula**: $C_6H_{14}$ | **Name**: Hexene, **Formula**: $C_6H_{12}$ | **Name**: Hexyne, **Formula**: $C_6H_{10}$ |

## Example 5

Give the significance of homologous series.

**Solution**
The significance of homologous series is as follows:
(i) The nature of any member of a family of compounds can be ascertained, if the properties of the first few members of that series are known.
(ii) It helps to predict the properties of even those members of the series that are yet to be prepared.
(iii) Knowledge of homologous series is useful for the systematic study of organic chemistry as it saves learning time.

## Example 6

Can all the members of a homologous series be prepared by using the same general method of preparation?

**Solution**
All the members of a homologous series can be prepared by using a same general method of preparation. For example, alcohols are prepared from alkyl halides as follows:
$$CH_3Br + KOH(aqueous) \xrightarrow{Boil} CH_3OH + KBr$$
$$C_2H_5Br + KOH(aqueous) \xrightarrow{Boil} C_2H_5OH + KBr$$
