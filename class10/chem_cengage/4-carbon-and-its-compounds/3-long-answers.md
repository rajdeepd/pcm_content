# Long Answer Type Questions

22. Explain the formation of oxygen molecule.
23. What are the main properties of covalent compounds with respect to melting and boiling points, solubility and conductivity?
24. How will you show the formation of ethylene molecule with the help of Lewis dot structure?
25. Write the structural formulae for
(i) 2-methylbutane
(ii) 2-methylpropene
26. What is the difference between combustion and oxidation? Under what conditions an oxidation reaction becomes combustion?
27. (i) Define the term 'isomers'.
(ii) Draw two possible isomers of the compound with the molecular formula $\mathrm{C}_3 \mathrm{H}_6 \mathrm{O}$ and write their names.
(iii) Give the electron dot structures of the above two compounds.
28. With the help of an example, explain the process of hydrogenation. Mention the essential conditions for the reaction and state the change in physical property with the formation of the product.
29. What is the difference between the molecules of soaps and detergents? Explain the cleansing action of soaps.
30. A carboxylic acid (molecular formula $\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_4 \mathrm{O}_2$ ) reacts with alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a compound ' X . The alcohol on oxidation with alkaline $\mathrm{KMnO}_4$ followed by acidification gives the same carboxylic acid $\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_4 \mathrm{O}_2$.

## Answers

31. (i) Covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points". Justify this statement.
(ii) What is an ester? Describe an activity to form an ester in the school laboratory.
    Relation with Other Chemistry Concepts
    Esters are closely related to topics such as Carboxylic Acids (as their parent compounds) and Alcohols (as their co-reactants during esterification). They also connect with Nomenclature of Organic Compounds and are compared with Ethers to distinguish functional groups.

    Step-by-Step Reaction Example
    1. Set up the reaction between acetic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_3 \mathrm{COOH}\right)$ and ethanol $\left(\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_5 \mathrm{OH}\right)$ in presence of $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4$.
    2. Write the balanced equation:

    $$
    \mathrm{CH}_3 \mathrm{COOH}+\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_5 \mathrm{OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_3 \mathrm{COOC}_2 \mathrm{H}_5+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}
    $$

    3. Describe the ester product (ethyl acetate, fruity-smelling liquid).
    4. State that the reaction is reversible and needs heat and acid catalyst.
