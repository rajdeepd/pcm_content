# Short Answer Type Questions


11. Name one metal and one non-metal that exist in a liquid state at room temperature. Also, name two metals having a melting point less than 310 K $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.
12. An element reacts with oxygen to form an oxide, which dissolves in dilute hydrochloric acid. The oxide also turns a solution of red litmus blue. Is the element a metal or a non-metal? Explain with the help of a suitable example.
13. Name two non-metallic oxides which are acidic.
14. A metal $A$, which is used in the thermite process, when heated with oxygen gives an oxide $B$, which is amphoteric in nature. Identify $A$ and $B$. Write down the reactions of oxide $B$ with HCl and NaOH .
15. An element $A$ reacts with water to form a compound $B$, which is used in whitewashing. Heating the compound $B$ forms an oxide $C$, which, on treatment with water, gives back $B$. Identify $A, B$ and $C$ and give the reactions involved.
16. What is the reactivity series of metals? Rearrange the following metals in an increasing order of reactivity:
Aluminium, Zinc, Mercury and Gold.
17. A solution of $\mathrm{CuSO}_4$ was kept in an iron pot. After a few days, the iron pot was found to have a number of holes in it. Explain the reason in terms of reactivity. Write the equation of the reaction involved.
18. (i) Show the formation of sodium oxide $\left(\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{O}\right)$ and magnesium oxide $(\mathrm{MgO})$ by the transfer of electrons.
(ii) Name the ions present in these compounds.
19. "All ores are minerals, but all minerals are not ores". Justify the statement with examples.
20. The following reaction takes place when aluminium powder is heated with $\mathrm{MnO}_2$

$$
3 \mathrm{MnO}_2(\mathrm{~s})+4 \mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{~s}) \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{Mn}(l)+2 \mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm{O}_3(l)+\text { Heat }
$$

(a) Is aluminium getting reduced?
(b) Is $\mathrm{MnO}_2$ getting oxidized?

# Answers



11. Hg, Br
12. **Metal.**
    *   **Reason:** The oxide turns red litmus blue, indicating it is a **basic oxide**. Metal oxides are generally basic in nature.
    *   **Example:** Magnesium (Mg).
        *   Reaction with Oxygen: $2Mg + O_2 \rightarrow 2MgO$ (Basic Oxide)
        *   Reaction with HCl: $MgO + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2O$
13. Non metallic oxides which are acidic  : Carbon dioxide, Sulphur dioxide
14. **A:** Aluminium (Al), **B:** Aluminium Oxide ($Al_2O_3$).
    *   **Reaction with HCl:** $Al_2O_3 + 6HCl \rightarrow 2AlCl_3 + 3H_2O$
    *   **Reaction with NaOH:** $Al_2O_3 + 2NaOH \rightarrow 2NaAlO_2 + H_2O$ (Sodium Aluminate)
15. **A:** Calcium (Ca), **B:** Calcium Hydroxide ($Ca(OH)_2$), **C:** Calcium Oxide (CaO).
    *   $Ca + 2H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2 + H_2$
    *   $Ca(OH)_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} CaO + H_2O$
    *   $CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2$
16. **Reactivity Series:** The arrangement of metals in the decreasing order of their reactivities.
    *   **Increasing Order:** Gold < Mercury < Zinc < Aluminium.
17. **Reason:** Iron is more reactive than Copper. It displaces copper from copper sulphate solution.
    *   **Equation:** $Fe(s) + CuSO_4(aq) \rightarrow FeSO_4(aq) + Cu(s)$
18. **(i) Formation:**
    *   **Sodium Oxide ($Na_2O$):**
        $Na \rightarrow Na^+ + e^-$ (x2)
        $O + 2e^- \rightarrow O^{2-}$
        $2Na^+ + O^{2-} \rightarrow Na_2O$
    *   **Magnesium Oxide ($MgO$):**
        $Mg \rightarrow Mg^{2+} + 2e^-$
        $O + 2e^- \rightarrow O^{2-}$
        $Mg^{2+} + O^{2-} \rightarrow MgO$
    **(ii) Ions Present:**
    *   In $Na_2O$: Sodium ion ($Na^+$) and Oxide ion ($O^{2-}$).
    *   In $MgO$: Magnesium ion ($Mg^{2+}$) and Oxide ion ($O^{2-}$).
19. **Minerals:** Naturally occurring substances in the earth's crust containing metals.
    **Ores:** Minerals from which metals can be extracted profitably and conveniently.
    *   **Example:** Clay is a mineral of Aluminium, but Bauxite is an ore of Aluminium.
20. (a) **Yes**, Aluminium is getting oxidized (gains oxygen).
    (b) **Yes**, $MnO_2$ is getting reduced (loses oxygen).
