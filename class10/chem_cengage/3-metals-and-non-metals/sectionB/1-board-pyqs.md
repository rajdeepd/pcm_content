**<a id="answer-1"></a>1.** What is meant by electrolytic reduction? How is sodium obtained from its molten chloride? Explain.

**Answer:**

**What is Electrolytic Reduction?**
- It's a process using electrical energy (electrolysis) to break down a compound (like an ore or molten salt) and reduce metal ions to their pure elemental form.
- A strong electric current drives the chemical change, forcing metal cations ($M^{+}$) to gain electrons (reduction) at the cathode (negative electrode).

**How Sodium is Obtained from Molten Sodium Chloride (NaCl):**

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Downs_cell_diagram.jpg"/>

1. **Setup:** An electrolytic cell contains molten (liquid) sodium chloride, acting as the electrolyte. Two electrodes (cathode and anode) are immersed in it.

2. **Ionization:** When current flows, NaCl dissociates into mobile sodium ions ($\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) and chloride ions ($\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$).

3. **At the Cathode (Negative Electrode):** $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions are attracted to the cathode, gain an electron, and are reduced to molten sodium metal.
   
   *Reaction:* $$\mathrm{Na}^{+} + e^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{l})$$

4. **At the Anode (Positive Electrode):** $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ions are attracted to the anode, lose electrons, and are oxidized to chlorine gas.
   
   *Reaction:* $$2\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 2e^{-}$$

5. **Separation:** The molten sodium (less dense) rises and is collected, while chlorine gas is collected separately at the anode to prevent it from reacting back with the sodium.

**Overall Reaction:**

$$2\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Electrolysis}} 2\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{Cl}_2(\mathrm{g})$$

**<a id="answer-2"></a>2.** Name the solvent in which electrovalent compounds are soluble and the solvent in which they are insoluble.

**Answer:**

An electrovalent compound, also known as an ionic compound, is a chemical compound formed by the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another, typically from a metal to a non-metal. This transfer creates oppositely charged ions (a positive cation and

Ionic Bond (Electrovalent Bond)
a negative anion) that are held together by strong electrostatic forces. A common example is sodium chloride ( NaCl ), formed when a sodium atom loses an electron to a chlorine atom.

Electrovalent (ionic) compounds, like NaCl , are generally soluble in polar solvents (like water) because the solvent's dipoles break the ionic bonds, but insoluble in nonpolar solvents (like petrol, benzene, kerosene) as they can't overcome the strong electrostatic forces. This "like dissolves like" principle means polar solvents dissolve polar/ionic substances, while nonpolar solvents dissolve nonpolar substances. ©

**<a id="answer-4"></a>4.** $\mathrm{P}, \mathrm{Q}$, and R are three elements that undergo chemical reactions according to the following equations: **[CBSE 2014]**

- (a) $\mathrm{P}_2 \mathrm{O}_3 + 2\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}_2 \mathrm{O}_3 + 2\mathrm{P}$
- (b) $3\mathrm{RSO}_4 + 2\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}_2\left(\mathrm{SO}_4\right)_3 + 3\mathrm{R}$
- (c) $3\mathrm{RO} + 2\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}_2 \mathrm{O}_3 + 3\mathrm{R}$

Answer the following:
- (i) Which element is the most reactive?
- (ii) Which element is the least reactive?
- (iii) State the type of reaction listed above.

**Answer:**

P replaces R, Q replaces P, Q replaces R

(i) Q is most reactive.   
(ii) R is least reactive.   
(iii) Displacement reaction.

**<a id="answer-5"></a>5.** Why does calcium float on water?

**Answer:**

When calcium reacts with water, it forms calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas produced adheres to the surface of the calcium, creating buoyant bubbles that make the metal float on the water’s surface. The formation of hydrogen gas during the reaction is exothermic, and the released heat contributes to the buoyancy. The hydrogen bubbles displace water and reduce the overall density of the calcium, causing it to rise and appear to float. This phenomenon is characteristic of the reactivity of certain metals with water and showcases the displacement of water by the evolved gas during the chemical reaction.

**<a id="answer-6"></a>6.** Give reasons for the following: **[CBSE 2014]**

- (i) Generally, no hydrogen gas is evolved when metals react with dilute nitric acid.
- (ii) Sodium hydroxide solution cannot be kept in aluminium containers.
- (iii) Silver metal does not combine easily with oxygen, but silver jewellery tarnishes after some time.
- (iv) Sodium is obtained by the electrolysis of its molten chloride and not from its aqueous solution.
- (v) Aluminium reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid slowly in the beginning.

**Answer:**

- (i) That statement is generally true because nitric acid (HNO₃) is a strong oxidizing agent, so it oxidizes the hydrogen (H) produced to water (\(H_{2}O\)), while the nitric acid itself gets reduced to various nitrogen oxides (like \(NO_{2}\), \(NO\), \(N_{2}O\)), preventing \(H_{2}\) gas from being evolved, except for very reactive metals like magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) with very dilute acid
- (ii) Sodium hydroxide $(\mathrm{NaOH})$ solution cannot be stored in aluminum containers because it reacts with the aluminum, corroding the metal and producing highly flammable hydrogen gas, which creates safety hazards like container failure and potential explosions. The chemical reaction forms sodium aluminate and hydrogen gas: $2 \mathrm{Al}+2 \mathrm{NaOH}+2 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{NaAlO}_2+3 \mathrm{H}_2$ (or $2 \mathrm{Al}+2 \mathrm{NaOH}+6 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}\left[\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{OH})_4\right]+3 \mathrm{H}_2$ as a hydrated form).

   Why it's dangerous:
   - Corrosion: The strong base attacks the aluminum, weakening the container.
   - Hydrogen Gas: The released $H_2$ gas is flammable and can build up pressure, leading to container rupture.

  Safer Alternatives:
   - Sodium hydroxide is best stored in containers made of materials resistant to strong bases, such as certain plastics (HDPE, PVC) or stainless steel (316SS).
- (iii) - Sulfur compounds: Silver reacts with sulfur-containing gases like hydrogen sulfide ( $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{~S}$ ), which are present in the air from pollution, industrial emissions, or even certain foods (like eggs). This reaction creates silver sulfide ( $\mathrm{Ag}_2 \mathrm{~S}$ ), which is a black or dark gray film that dulls the metal.
- (iv) Sodium is extracted from molten NaCl (Downs process) because in aqueous NaCl , water is reduced instead of sodium ions ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) at the cathode, producing hydrogen gas ( $\mathrm{H}_2$ ) and sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) due to water's higher reduction potential, while the highly reactive sodium metal formed immediately reacts with water. Using molten salt eliminates water, allowing pure sodium metal to be produced by reducing $\mathrm{Na} a^{+}$ions.
- (v) Aluminium reacts slowly with dilute HCl at first because of a tough, protective layer of aluminium oxide ( $\mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ ) on its surface, which shields the metal; the acid first dissolves this oxide, and then the vigorous reaction to form aluminium chloride ( $\mathrm{AlCl}_3$ ) and hydrogen gas ( $H_2$ ) begins, leading to rapid bubbling.

  The Process Explained:
  1. Protective Layer: Aluminium naturally forms a very stable, hard, transparent oxide layer (like a natural coating) that prevents immediate contact with the acid.
  2. Initial Delay: The dilute HCl needs time to eat through or break down this $\mathrm{Al}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$ barrier, causing the initial slow start and few bubbles.
  3. Vigorous Reaction: Once the oxide layer is gone, the acid directly touches the pure aluminium, triggering a fast single displacement reaction, producing lots of hydrogen gas bubbles and accelerating the reaction rate.

  Chemical Equation:

  $
  2 \mathrm{Al}(s)+6 \mathrm{HCl}(a q) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{AlCl}_3(a q)+3 \mathrm{H}_2(g)
  $

**<a id="answer-7"></a>7.**  **[CBSE 2015]**

- (i) Write any two properties of ionic compounds.
- (ii) Show the formation of aluminium chloride by the transfer of electrons between the atoms. (Atomic number of aluminium and chlorine are 13 and 17, respectively.)

**Answer:**

Ionic compounds have ionic bonds and are formed between metals with extra electrons and non metails like Cl, Br etc.

**Key Properties of Ionic Compounds:**

1. **Physical State:** They are typically hard, crystalline solids at room temperature due to their giant, ordered crystal lattice structure.
2. **Melting & Boiling Points:** Have high melting and boiling points because strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions require a lot of energy to break.
3. **Hardness & Brittleness:** They are hard but brittle; applying pressure can cause layers of ions to shift, bringing like charges together, causing repulsion and breaking the crystal.
4. **Electrical Conductivity:**
   - *Solid State:* Poor conductors because ions are fixed in the lattice and can't move.
   - *Molten (Liquid) State/Aqueous Solution:* Good conductors as ions become free to move and carry charge.
5. **Solubility:** Generally soluble in polar solvents like water but insoluble in non-polar solvents (e.g., kerosene, petrol).
6. **Nature of Bonds:** Formed by strong electrostatic attraction between positive (metal) and negative (non-metal) ions, resulting in strong ionic bonds.

**<a id="answer-8"></a>8.** Account for the following: **[CBSE 2016]**

- (i) Electrical wires are coated with plastic.
- (ii) Carbon is not used for reducing aluminium from aluminium oxide.

**Answer:**


- (i) Plastic is bad conductor of electricty
- (ii) Carbon is not used for reducing aluminium from aluminium oxide: Carbon is not used to reduce aluminium from aluminium oxide (alumina) because aluminium has a much higher affinity for oxygen than carbon does, meaning carbon can't effectively displace the oxygen, even at high temperatures, requiring the electrolysis method (Hall-Héroult process) instead.
