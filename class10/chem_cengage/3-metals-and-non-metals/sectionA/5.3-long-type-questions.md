---
**<a id="answer-25"></a>25.** Describe two methods for the concentration of ores.

**Answers**

**Froth Flotation**

- Principle: Exploits differences in the surface properties (wettability) of the ore and gangue.
- Process: Finely powdered ore is mixed with water and oil (frother). Air is blown through the mixture, causing the valuable mineral particles (which prefer oil) to stick to air bubbles and form a froth, floating to the top, while the lighter gangue sinks.
- Used For: Sulfide ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead).

**Magnetic Separation**
- Principle: Uses differences in magnetic properties between the ore and gangue.
- Process: Ground ore is passed over a conveyor belt with a magnetic roller. Magnetic minerals are attracted to the roller and fall off at a different point than the nonmagnetic gangue.
- Used For: Ores like magnetite, hematite (iron ore), chromite, and manganese ores.

**Other Methods**

- Gravity Separation/Hydraulic Washing: Separates based on density differences, using water streams to wash away lighter gangue.
- Leaching: Uses chemical solvents to dissolve the metal from the ore into a solution, separating it from impurities.

**<a id="answer-26"></a>26.**

(a) Name the main ore of mercury. How is mercury obtained from its ore? Give the balanced chemical equations.

(b) What are thermite reactions? How is it used to join the railway tracks or cracked machine parts?

(c) Name the method used to extract metals with high reactivity.

**Answer**

(a) 

The main ore of mercury is Cinnabar (HgS), and it's obtained by heating it in air (roasting) to form mercury oxide, which then decomposes into liquid mercury and oxygen upon further heating, with balanced equations: $2 \mathrm{HgS}+3 \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}+2 \mathrm{SO}_2$ (roasting) and $2 \mathrm{HgO} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Hg}+\mathrm{O}_2$ (decomposition).

**Extraction Process**

1. **Roasting:** Cinnabar (HgS) is heated in the presence of excess oxygen (air) in a furnace, converting it to mercury(II) oxide (HgO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
   - Equation: $2 \mathrm{HgS}(s)+3 \mathrm{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)+2 \mathrm{SO}_2(g)$

2. **Decomposition:** The resulting mercury $(\mathrm{II})$ oxide $(\mathrm{HgO})$ is then heated to about $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, causing it to decompose into liquid mercury (Hg) and oxygen (O2).
   - Equation: $2 \mathrm{HgO}(s) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Hg}(l)+\mathrm{O}_2(g)$

3. **Condensation:** The mercury vapor produced is collected and condensed into liquid mercury, often using water-cooled condensers.

(b) **Thermite Reactions:**

**Definition:** Thermite is a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxide. The reaction is also called the **Goldschmidt process**.

**Mechanism:**

- The thermite reaction is an **exothermic reduction-oxidation reaction** between a metal and metal oxide
- When ignited by heat, it creates brief bursts of extreme heat and high temperature in a small area
- **Common fuels:** Aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron
- **Aluminium** is most common due to its high boiling point and low cost
- Aluminium acts as a **reducing agent** with metal oxides (commonly iron oxide/rust)

**Chemical Equation:**
$$\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{O}_3(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \text{Heat}$$

**Applications:**

- **Thermite welding** - joining railway tracks and cracked machine parts
- Metal refining and purification
- Industrial welding applications
- The extreme heat melts the iron produced, allowing it to fuse materials

**Historical Note:**
First commercial application was welding tram tracks in Essen (1899). Types include iron thermite, copper thermite, and thermates.

> **_NOTE:_** The thermite reaction was discovered in 1893 and patented in 1895 by German chemist **Hans Goldschmidt**. He originally sought to produce pure metals without carbon but discovered its welding applications.

(c) **Method for Extracting Highly Reactive Metals:**

**Answer: Electrolytic Reduction**

**Principle:**

- Metals high up in the reactivity series (Na, Mg, Ca, Al) are **very reactive**
- They **cannot be obtained** from their compounds by heating with carbon
- **Reason:** These metals have **greater affinity for oxygen** than carbon
- Carbon reduction is ineffective for these highly reactive metals

**Method - Electrolytic Reduction:**

**Process:**
1. **Electrolysis of molten salts** (usually chlorides or oxides)
2. **Cathode (negative electrode):** Metal ions gain electrons → Pure metal deposited
3. **Anode (positive electrode):** Non-metal ions lose electrons → Gas liberated

**Examples:**

**Sodium, Magnesium, Calcium extraction:**
- **Process:** Electrolysis of molten chlorides
- **Cathode reaction:** $\mathrm{Na^{+}} + \mathrm{e^{-}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}$
- **Anode reaction:** $2\mathrm{Cl^{-}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl_2} + 2\mathrm{e^{-}}$

**Aluminium extraction:**
- **Process:** Electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide (Hall-Héroult process)
- **Method:** Electrolysis of molten Al₂O₃ dissolved in cryolite

**Key Point:** Electrolytic reduction is the **only practical method** for extracting metals above carbon in the reactivity series.

   - Copper from impure anode dissolves as Cu²⁺ ions
   - **Reaction:** $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{e}^{-}$
   - Impurities either dissolve or settle as anode mud

2. **At Cathode (Reduction):**
   - Cu²⁺ ions from solution get deposited as pure copper
   - **Reaction:** $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s})$

**Advantages:**
- **High Purity:** Produces 99.9% pure copper
- **Recovery of Valuable Metals:** Precious metals like silver, gold settle as anode mud

**Answer:**

**Metals of Low and Medium Reactivity:** These include metals like copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), etc. They are found in the middle of the reactivity series and can be extracted from their sulphide ores through a systematic process.

**General Steps for Extraction from Sulphide Ores:**

**Step 1: Crushing and Grinding**
- **Purpose:** Break down the ore into smaller particles to increase surface area
- **Process:** Large chunks of ore are crushed in jaw crushers and then ground in ball mills
- **Result:** Fine powder that increases efficiency of subsequent processes

**Step 2: Concentration of Ore**
- **Purpose:** Separate valuable minerals from gangue (unwanted material)
- **Common Methods:**
  - **Froth Flotation:** Most widely used for sulphide ores
  - **Magnetic Separation:** For magnetic materials
  - **Gravity Separation:** Based on density differences
- **Process:** Ore particles are made to stick to oil bubbles and float, while gangue sinks
- **Result:** Concentrated ore with higher metal content

**Step 3: Roasting**
- **Purpose:** Convert sulphide ore to oxide and remove sulphur
- **Process:** Heated strongly in presence of excess air (oxygen)
- **Temperature:** 800-900°C
- **General Reaction:** $2\mathrm{MS}(\mathrm{s}) + 3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{MO}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$
- **Examples:**
  - $2\mathrm{ZnS} + 3\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{ZnO} + 2\mathrm{SO}_2$

**<a id="answer-31"></a>31.** A man went door to door posing as a goldsmith. He promised to bring back the glitter of old and dull gold ornaments. An unsuspecting lady gave a set of gold bangles to him which he dipped in a particular solution. The bangles sparkled like new, but their weight was reduced drastically. The lady was upset but after a futile argument the man beat a hasty retreat. Can you play the detective to find out the nature of the solution he had used?

**Answer:**

**Detective Analysis:**

**The Solution Used: Aqua Regia**

**Composition:**
- **Aqua regia** is a mixture of **nitric acid (HNO₃)** and **hydrochloric acid (HCl)**
- **Optimal ratio:** 1:3 (HNO₃ : HCl)
- **Meaning:** "Royal water" - called so because it can dissolve gold, the "king of metals"

**What Happened:**
1. **Surface Cleaning:** The aqua regia dissolved the outer tarnished/dull layer of gold
2. **Weight Loss:** Some gold was dissolved and removed from the bangles
3. **Shine Restoration:** The inner, cleaner gold surface was exposed, making bangles sparkle
4. **Chemical Reaction:** $\mathrm{Au} + \mathrm{HNO_3} + 4\mathrm{HCl} \rightarrow \mathrm{HAuCl_4} + \mathrm{NO} + 2\mathrm{H_2O}$

**Why This Works:**
- Gold is normally **very unreactive** and doesn't dissolve in single acids
- **Aqua regia** is the only common acid mixture that can dissolve gold
- The **combination** of oxidizing (HNO₃) and complexing (HCl) agents makes this possible

**The Fraud:**
- The man **stole gold** by dissolving the outer layer
- He made the ornaments **look better** but **reduced their actual value**
- This is a form of **cheating** - improving appearance while stealing material
