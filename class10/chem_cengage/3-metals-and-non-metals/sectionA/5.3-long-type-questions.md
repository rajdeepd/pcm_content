**<a id="answer-25"></a>25.** Describe two methods for the concentration of ores.

**Answers**

**Froth Flotation**

- Principle: Exploits differences in the surface properties (wettability) of the ore and gangue.
- Process: Finely powdered ore is mixed with water and oil (frother). Air is blown through the mixture, causing the valuable mineral particles (which prefer oil) to stick to air bubbles and form a froth, floating to the top, while the lighter gangue sinks.
- Used For: Sulfide ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead).

**Magnetic Separation**
- Principle: Uses differences in magnetic properties between the ore and gangue.
- Process: Ground ore is passed over a conveyor belt with a magnetic roller. Magnetic minerals are attracted to the roller and fall off at a different point than the nonmagnetic gangue.
- Used For: Ores like magnetite, hematite (iron ore), chromite, and manganese ores.

**Other Methods**

- Gravity Separation/Hydraulic Washing: Separates based on density differences, using water streams to wash away lighter gangue.
- Leaching: Uses chemical solvents to dissolve the metal from the ore into a solution, separating it from impurities.

**<a id="answer-26"></a>26.**

(a) Name the main ore of mercury. How is mercury obtained from its ore? Give the balanced chemical equations.

(b) What are thermite reactions? How is it used to join the railway tracks or cracked machine parts?

(c) Name the method used to extract metals with high reactivity.

**Answer**

(a) 

The main ore of mercury is Cinnabar (HgS), and it's obtained by heating it in air (roasting) to form mercury oxide, which then decomposes into liquid mercury and oxygen upon further heating, with balanced equations: $2 \mathrm{HgS}+3 \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}+2 \mathrm{SO}_2$ (roasting) and $2 \mathrm{HgO} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Hg}+\mathrm{O}_2$ (decomposition).

**Extraction Process**

1. **Roasting:** Cinnabar (HgS) is heated in the presence of excess oxygen (air) in a furnace, converting it to mercury(II) oxide (HgO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2).
   - Equation: $2 \mathrm{HgS}(s)+3 \mathrm{O}_2(g) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HgO}(s)+2 \mathrm{SO}_2(g)$

2. **Decomposition:** The resulting mercury $(\mathrm{II})$ oxide $(\mathrm{HgO})$ is then heated to about $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, causing it to decompose into liquid mercury (Hg) and oxygen (O2).
   - Equation: $2 \mathrm{HgO}(s) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Hg}(l)+\mathrm{O}_2(g)$

3. **Condensation:** The mercury vapor produced is collected and condensed into liquid mercury, often using water-cooled condensers.

(b) **Thermite Reactions:**

**Definition:** Thermite is a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder and metal oxide. The reaction is also called the **Goldschmidt process**.

**Mechanism:**

- The thermite reaction is an **exothermic reduction-oxidation reaction** between a metal and metal oxide
- When ignited by heat, it creates brief bursts of extreme heat and high temperature in a small area
- **Common fuels:** Aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron
- **Aluminium** is most common due to its high boiling point and low cost
- Aluminium acts as a **reducing agent** with metal oxides (commonly iron oxide/rust)

**Chemical Equation:**
$$\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{O}_3(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{Al}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3(\mathrm{s}) + \text{Heat}$$

**Applications:**

- **Thermite welding** - joining railway tracks and cracked machine parts
- Metal refining and purification
- Industrial welding applications
- The extreme heat melts the iron produced, allowing it to fuse materials

**Historical Note:**
First commercial application was welding tram tracks in Essen (1899). Types include iron thermite, copper thermite, and thermates.

> **_NOTE:_** The thermite reaction was discovered in 1893 and patented in 1895 by German chemist **Hans Goldschmidt**. He originally sought to produce pure metals without carbon but discovered its welding applications.

(c) **Method for Extracting Highly Reactive Metals:**

**Answer: Electrolytic Reduction**

**Principle:**

- Metals high up in the reactivity series (Na, Mg, Ca, Al) are **very reactive**
- They **cannot be obtained** from their compounds by heating with carbon
- **Reason:** These metals have **greater affinity for oxygen** than carbon
- Carbon reduction is ineffective for these highly reactive metals

**Method - Electrolytic Reduction:**

**Process:**
1. **Electrolysis of molten salts** (usually chlorides or oxides)
2. **Cathode (negative electrode):** Metal ions gain electrons → Pure metal deposited
3. **Anode (positive electrode):** Non-metal ions lose electrons → Gas liberated

**Examples:**

**Sodium, Magnesium, Calcium extraction:**
- **Process:** Electrolysis of molten chlorides
- **Cathode reaction:** $\mathrm{Na^{+}} + \mathrm{e^{-}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}$
- **Anode reaction:** $2\mathrm{Cl^{-}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl_2} + 2\mathrm{e^{-}}$

**Aluminium extraction:**
- **Process:** Electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide (Hall-Héroult process)
- **Method:** Electrolysis of molten Al₂O₃ dissolved in cryolite

**Key Point:** Electrolytic reduction is the **only practical method** for extracting metals above carbon in the reactivity series.

**(ii) How does electrolytic refining purify impure copper?**

**Answer:**

**(i) Extraction of Copper from Sulphide Ore:**

**Ore Used:** Copper pyrite (CuFeS₂) or Chalcopyrite

**Process Steps:**

**1. Concentration of Ore:**
- **Froth flotation method** is used to separate the ore from gangue
- The ore particles stick to oil bubbles and float to the surface

**2. Roasting:**
- The concentrated ore is heated in the presence of excess air (oxygen)
- Sulphur is removed as SO₂ gas
- **Equation:** $2\mathrm{CuFeS}_2(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{FeS}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$

**3. Smelting (Reduction):**
- The roasted ore is mixed with coke and silica, then heated in a blast furnace
- Iron sulphide is converted to iron oxide and removed as slag
- **Equations:**
  - $2\mathrm{FeS}(\mathrm{s}) + 3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{FeO}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$
  - $\mathrm{FeO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{SiO}_2(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{FeSiO}_3(\mathrm{l})$ (slag)

**4. Bessemerization (Final Reduction):**
- Cu₂S is reduced to metallic copper by blowing air through molten matte
- **Equations:**
  - $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$
  - $2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{l}) + 3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$
  - $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{l}) + 2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow 6\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$

**(ii) Electrolytic Refining of Copper:**

**Principle:** Impure copper is purified using electrolysis

**Setup:**
- **Anode:** Impure copper (to be purified)
- **Cathode:** Pure copper strip (thin sheet)
- **Electrolyte:** Copper sulphate solution (CuSO₄) + dilute sulphuric acid (H₂SO₄)

**Process:**
1. **At Anode (Oxidation):**
   - Copper from impure anode dissolves as Cu²⁺ ions
   - **Reaction:** $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{e}^{-}$
   - Impurities either dissolve or settle as anode mud

2. **At Cathode (Reduction):**
   - Cu²⁺ ions from solution get deposited as pure copper
   - **Reaction:** $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}(\mathrm{aq}) + 2\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s})$

**Advantages:**
- **High Purity:** Produces 99.9% pure copper
- **Recovery of Valuable Metals:** Precious metals like silver, gold settle as anode mud
- **Economical:** Cost-effective purification method

**Applications:** Purified copper is used in electrical wiring, cables, and electronic components.

**<a id="answer-28"></a>28.** Give the steps involved in the extraction of metals of low and medium reactivity from their respective sulphide ores.

**Answer:**

**Metals of Low and Medium Reactivity:** These include metals like copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), etc. They are found in the middle of the reactivity series and can be extracted from their sulphide ores through a systematic process.

**General Steps for Extraction from Sulphide Ores:**

**Step 1: Crushing and Grinding**
- **Purpose:** Break down the ore into smaller particles to increase surface area
- **Process:** Large chunks of ore are crushed in jaw crushers and then ground in ball mills
- **Result:** Fine powder that increases efficiency of subsequent processes

**Step 2: Concentration of Ore**
- **Purpose:** Separate valuable minerals from gangue (unwanted material)
- **Common Methods:**
  - **Froth Flotation:** Most widely used for sulphide ores
  - **Magnetic Separation:** For magnetic materials
  - **Gravity Separation:** Based on density differences
- **Process:** Ore particles are made to stick to oil bubbles and float, while gangue sinks
- **Result:** Concentrated ore with higher metal content

**Step 3: Roasting**
- **Purpose:** Convert sulphide ore to oxide and remove sulphur
- **Process:** Heated strongly in presence of excess air (oxygen)
- **Temperature:** 800-900°C
- **General Reaction:** $2\mathrm{MS}(\mathrm{s}) + 3\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{MO}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{g})$
- **Examples:**
  - $2\mathrm{ZnS} + 3\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{ZnO} + 2\mathrm{SO}_2$
  - $2\mathrm{PbS} + 3\mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\mathrm{PbO} + 2\mathrm{SO}_2$

**Step 4: Smelting/Reduction**
- **Purpose:** Reduce metal oxide to free metal
- **Reducing Agent:** Carbon (coke), carbon monoxide, or other metals
- **Process:** Roasted ore is mixed with coke and flux, then heated in blast furnace
- **Temperature:** 1200-1500°C
- **General Reactions:**
  - $\mathrm{MO} + \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{M} + \mathrm{CO}$
  - $\mathrm{MO} + \mathrm{CO} \rightarrow \mathrm{M} + \mathrm{CO}_2$
- **Examples:**
  - $\mathrm{ZnO} + \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn} + \mathrm{CO}$
  - $\mathrm{PbO} + \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{Pb} + \mathrm{CO}$

**Step 5: Refining**
- **Purpose:** Purify the extracted metal
- **Methods:**
  - **Electrolytic Refining:** For copper, zinc (high purity)
  - **Distillation:** For zinc, mercury
  - **Oxidative Refining:** For lead
  - **Zone Refining:** For very high purity requirements
- **Result:** Pure metal suitable for commercial use

**Key Points:**
- **Flux Addition:** Silica (SiO₂) or limestone (CaCO₃) added to remove impurities as slag
- **Environmental Concern:** SO₂ gas produced is captured to prevent pollution
- **Energy Intensive:** High temperatures required make the process energy-consuming
- **Economic Viability:** Only ores with sufficient metal content are processed

**Summary Flow:**
**Raw Ore → Crushing → Concentration → Roasting → Reduction → Refining → Pure Metal**
