**<a id="answer-33"></a>33.** A non-metal $A$ is an important constituent of our food and forms two oxides, $B$ and $C$. Oxide $B$ is toxic, whereas $C$ causes global warming.

- (i) Identify $A, B$, and $C$.
- (ii) To which group of periodic table does $A$ belong?

**Answer:**

**(i) Identification:**
- **$A = $ Carbon (C)** - Essential constituent of food (carbohydrates, proteins, fats)
- **$B = $ Carbon monoxide (CO)** - Toxic oxide, causes poisoning
- **$C = $ Carbon dioxide (CO₂)** - Greenhouse gas causing global warming

**(ii) Group in Periodic Table:**
- **Carbon belongs to Group 14 (Group IV)** of the periodic table
- **Valency:** 4 (can form 4 covalent bonds)
- **Electronic configuration:** 2, 4

**Justification:**
- **Food component:** Carbon is the backbone of all organic molecules (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids)
- **Toxic oxide:** CO binds to hemoglobin more readily than oxygen, causing suffocation
- **Global warming:** CO₂ traps heat in atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse effect

**<a id="answer-34"></a>34.** Iqbal treated a lustrous, divalent element $M$ with sodium hydroxide. He observed the formation of bubbles in reaction mixture. He made the same observations when this element was treated with hydrochloric acid. Suggest how can he identify the produced gas. Write chemical equations for both the reactions.

**Answer:**

**Gas Identification:**

**The gas produced is Hydrogen (H₂)**

**Test for Hydrogen Gas:**
- **Method:** Bring a burning matchstick or splinter near the mouth of the test tube
- **Observation:** The gas will ignite with a distinctive **"pop" sound**
- **Confirmation:** This characteristic sound confirms the presence of hydrogen gas

**Element Identification:**

**Element M is an amphoteric metal**, most likely **Zinc (Zn)** or **Aluminum (Al)**
- **Property:** Amphoteric metals react with both acids and strong alkalis
- **Characteristic:** Lustrous, divalent (forms M²⁺ ions)

**Chemical Equations:**

**Reaction with Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH):**
$$\mathrm{Zn}(s) + 2\mathrm{NaOH}(aq) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \mathrm{Na_2ZnO_2}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2}(g)$$
**(Sodium zincate formation)**

**Reaction with Hydrochloric Acid (HCl):**
$$\mathrm{Zn}(s) + 2\mathrm{HCl}(aq) \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnCl_2}(aq) + \mathrm{H_2}(g)$$
**(Zinc chloride formation)**

**Key Points:**
- **Amphoteric nature:** Element M reacts with both acid and base
- **Heat requirement:** Reaction with NaOH typically requires heating
- **Divalent nature:** Forms M²⁺ ions in compounds
- **Hydrogen evolution:** Both reactions produce H₂ gas with bubbling

**<a id="answer-35"></a>35.** Giving one example of each, explain the method of obtaining the following metals from their compounds.

- Metal 'A' - Placed low in the activity series.
- Metal 'B' - In the middle in the activity series.
- Metal 'C' - Towards the top of the activity series.

**Answer:**

**Metal 'A' - Low in Activity Series (Example: Mercury)**

**Method: Simple Heating/Thermal Decomposition**

- **Principle:** Metals low in activity series are least reactive and can be extracted by simple heating
- **Process:** Direct heating of metal sulfide ores
- **Example:** Mercury from Cinnabar (HgS)
- **Chemical Equation:** 
  $$\mathrm{HgS}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{O_2}(\mathrm{g}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \mathrm{Hg}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{SO_2}(\mathrm{g})$$
- **Why this works:** Mercury is so unreactive that its oxide decomposes easily into metal and oxygen

**Metal 'B' - Middle in Activity Series (Example: Iron)**

**Method: Roasting + Carbon Reduction**

- **Principle:** Moderate reactivity allows reduction by carbon
- **Process:** 
  1. **Roasting:** Convert sulfide ore to oxide
  2. **Reduction:** Use carbon/coke in blast furnace
- **Example:** Iron from Hematite (Fe₂O₃)
- **Chemical Equations:**
  
  *Roasting (if sulfide ore):*
  $$2\mathrm{FeS}(\mathrm{s}) + 3\mathrm{O_2}(\mathrm{g}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} 2\mathrm{FeO}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{SO_2}(\mathrm{g})$$
  
  *Reduction in blast furnace:*
  $$\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}(\mathrm{s}) + 3\mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} 2\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{l}) + 3\mathrm{CO_2}(\mathrm{g})$$

**Metal 'C' - Top in Activity Series (Example: Sodium)**

**Method: Electrolytic Reduction**

- **Principle:** Highly reactive metals cannot be reduced by carbon
- **Process:** Electrolysis of molten salts
- **Example:** Sodium from molten NaCl
- **Setup:**
  - **Cathode:** Steel (where Na is deposited)
  - **Anode:** Graphite (where Cl₂ is liberated)
  - **Electrolyte:** Molten NaCl
- **Chemical Equations:**
  
  *At Cathode:* $\mathrm{Na^+} + \mathrm{e^-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}$
  
  *At Anode:* $2\mathrm{Cl^-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cl_2} + 2\mathrm{e^-}$
  
  *Overall:* $2\mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Electrolysis}} 2\mathrm{Na}(\mathrm{l}) + \mathrm{Cl_2}(\mathrm{g})$

**Summary:**

| Activity Series | Metal Example | Method | Key Process |
|----------------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| **Low** | Mercury (Hg) | Thermal decomposition | Simple heating |
| **Middle** | Iron (Fe) | Carbon reduction | Roasting + Blast furnace |
| **High** | Sodium (Na) | Electrolytic reduction | Electrolysis of molten salts | 


**<a id="answer-36"></a>36.** What happens when

- (a) $\mathrm{ZnCO}_3$ is heated in the absence of oxygen?
- (b) A mixture of $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S}$ is heated?

**Answer**

$ZnCO_3 \rightarrow ZnO + CO_2 \newline$

$2\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{O} + 6\mathrm{Cu}_2\mathrm{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu} + SO_2 $

**<a id="answer-37"></a>37.** In the formation of a compound $XY_2$, atom $X$ donates one electron to each $Y$ atom. Show the electron dot structure of $X$ and $Y$ and the formation of $XY_2$. What is the nature of the bond in $XY_2$? Write any three properties of $XY_2$. The electronic configuration of these elements $X$ and $Y$ are as follows:

- $X: 2, 8, 2$
- $Y: 2, 7$

**Answer:**

**Element Identification:**
- **Element $X$:** Electronic configuration $2, 8, 2$ → Metal with 2 valence electrons (Group 2, likely Magnesium or Calcium)
- **Element $Y$:** Electronic configuration $2, 7$ → Non-metal with 7 valence electrons (Group 17, likely Chlorine)

**Electron Dot Structures:**

*Atom $X$ (before bonding):*
$$\mathrm{X} : \cdot \cdot$$
(2 valence electrons)

*Atom $Y$ (before bonding):*
$$: \ddot{\mathrm{Y}} \cdot$$
(7 valence electrons, needs 1 more to complete octet)

**Formation of $XY_2$:**
- $X$ will **lose two electrons** to two atoms of $Y$
- Each $Y$ atom gains one electron to complete its octet
- **Ionic equation:** $\mathrm{X} \rightarrow \mathrm{X}^{2+} + 2\mathrm{e}^-$ and $2\mathrm{Y} + 2\mathrm{e}^- \rightarrow 2\mathrm{Y}^-$

**Nature of Bond:**
- The bond in $XY_2$ is an **ionic bond** (electrovalent bond)
- Formed by complete transfer of electrons from metal $X$ to non-metal $Y$

**Three Properties of $XY_2$:**

1. **High melting and boiling point** - Strong electrostatic forces between ions
2. **Conducts electricity in molten or aqueous state** - Free ions act as charge carriers
3. **Soluble in water** - Polar water molecules can separate the ions
