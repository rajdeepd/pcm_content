## 3.2 Chemical Properties of Non-metals

### (A) Reaction with Oxygen

**Non-metals combine with oxygen to form acidic oxides.** Some of these oxides dissolve in water to produce acids.

**General Equations:**

\\[
\\text{Non-metal + Oxygen} \\longrightarrow \\text{Non-metallic oxide}
\\]

\\[
\\text{Non-metallic oxide + Water} \\longrightarrow \\text{Acid}
\\]

**Some examples are as follows:**

**(i) Carbon + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide**

\\[
\\text{C} + \\text{O}_2 \\longrightarrow \\text{CO}_2
\\]

\\[
\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{CO}_3
\\]
\\[
\\text{Carbonic acid}
\\]

**(ii) Sulphur + Oxygen → Sulphur dioxide**

\\[
\\text{S} + \\text{O}_2 \\longrightarrow \\text{SO}_2
\\]

\\[
\\text{SO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3
\\]
\\[
\\text{Sulphurous acid}
\\]

**(iii) Phosphorus + Oxygen → Phosphorus pentoxide**

\\[
\\text{P}_4 + 5\\text{O}_2 \\longrightarrow 2\\text{P}_2\\text{O}_5
\\]

\\[
\\text{P}_2\\text{O}_5 + 3\\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\longrightarrow 2\\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_4
\\]
\\[
\\text{Phosphoric acid}
\\]

**Note:** Other oxides, such as **carbon monoxide (CO)** and **nitrous oxide (N₂O)** are **neutral in nature**.

---

### (B) Reaction with Acids

**Unlike metals, non-metals do not react with acids to liberate hydrogen gas.** However, **concentrated nitric acid** reacts with carbon (coke), sulphur and phosphorus as it is a **powerful oxidizing agent** and oxidizes the non-metals as shown below:

\\[
\\text{C} + 4\\text{HNO}_3(\\text{conc.}) \\longrightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 4\\text{NO}_2
\\]

\\[
\\text{S} + 6\\text{HNO}_3(\\text{conc.}) \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_4 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 6\\text{NO}_2
\\]

\\[
\\text{P} + 5\\text{HNO}_3(\\text{conc.}) \\xrightarrow{\\text{heat}} \\text{H}_3\\text{PO}_4 + 5\\text{NO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}
\\]

---

### (C) Reaction with Chlorine

**Non-metals react with chlorine to form chlorides.** The chlorides formed are **covalent in nature** and generally exist as **gases or liquids** at room temperature. For example,

**(i) Phosphorus reacts with chlorine to form phosphorus trichloride.**

\\[
\\text{P}_4(s) + 6\\text{Cl}_2(g) \\longrightarrow 4\\text{PCl}_3(g)
\\]

**(ii) Hydrogen reacts with chlorine to produce hydrogen chloride.**

\\[
\\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{Cl}_2(g) \\longrightarrow 2\\text{HCl}(g)
\\]

---

### (D) Reaction with Hydrogen

**Non-metals combine with hydrogen to form covalent hydrides.** Here are some examples:

**(i) Sulphur combines with hydrogen at 440°C to form hydrogen sulphide gas.**

\\[
\\text{H}_2(g) + \\text{S}(s) \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{S}(g)
\\]

**(ii) Nitrogen combines with hydrogen at about 500°C in the presence of iron catalyst to form ammonia. The reaction is of reversible nature.**

\\[
\\text{N}_2(g) + 3\\text{H}_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2\\text{NH}_3(g)
\\]
\\[
\\text{Ammonia}
\\]

**Non-metal hydrides are covalent in nature** because non-metals cannot provide electrons to hydrogen atoms to produce hydride ions (H⁻). Due to the non-existence of ions, **non-metallic hydrides are bad conductors of electricity**.

---

### (E) Reaction with Water

**Generally, non-metals do not react with water or steam.** This is because non-metals cannot give electrons to reduce hydrogen ions in water into hydrogen gas. For example,

\\[
\\text{S} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\longrightarrow \\text{No reaction}
\\]
\\[
\\text{Sulphur} \\quad \\text{Water}
\\]

\\[
\\text{C} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\longrightarrow \\text{No reaction}
\\]
\\[
\\text{Coke} \\quad \\text{Water}
\\]

---

### 💡 INSIGHTS

- **Coke is the purest form of carbon.**

- **Pure phosphorus exists in several forms called allotropes.** The different allotropes of phosphorus are white, red, violet, and black phosphorus. All the allotropes have **different physical properties**.

- By passing steam over red-hot coke at 1270 K in the presence of Ni as a **catalyst, hydrogen gas is formed** along with carbon monoxide.

\\[
\\text{C} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\xrightarrow[\\text{Ni/Pt/Pd}]{1270\\text{ K}} \\text{CO} + \\text{H}_2
\\]
\\[
\\text{Coke} \\quad \\text{Steam} \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\text{Water gas}
\\]

The mixture of CO + H₂ is called **water gas, synthesis gas, or syn gas**.

| **4.** | **Reaction with water**<br>(i) Na and K react violently with cold water. Evolved H₂ gas catches fire.<br>2K(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H₂(g)<br>2Na(s) + 2H₂O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H₂(g)<br><br>(ii) Magnesium reacts with hot water.<br>Mg(s) + 2H₂O(l) → Mg(OH)₂(aq) + H₂(g) | (i) Generally, **non-metals do not react with water or steam** but their acidic oxides dissolve in water to produce acids. For example, aqueous solution of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and sulphur dioxide (SO₂) turn blue litmus to red.<br>CO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂CO₃(aq)<br>SO₂(g) + H₂O(l) → H₂SO₃(aq)<br><br>(ii) Aqueous solution of **neutral oxides** like CO and N₂O show no change with litmus paper. |
| **5.** | **Reaction with acids**<br>Metals generally react with dil. HCl and H₂SO₄ to liberate H₂ gas.<br>Metal + dil. acid → Salt + Hydrogen | Non-metals **do not displace H₂ from acids** because they are **electron acceptors**, and they **cannot supply electron to hydrogen**. |
| **6.** | **Reaction with chlorine**<br>Metals react with Cl₂ to form **ionic chlorides**. Metals are **electron donors**, and chlorine is electron acceptor.<br>Ca → Ca²⁺ + 2e⁻<br>2Cl + 2e⁻ → 2Cl⁻<br>Ca²⁺ + 2Cl⁻ → CaCl₂ | Non-metals react with Cl₂ to form **covalent chlorides**.<br>P₄(s) + 6Cl₂(g) → 4PCl₃(g) |
| **7.** | **Reaction with hydrogen**<br>Hydrogen can share or lose electrons. But **active metals** like Na, K and Ca can force hydrogen atom to accept the electrons to form **hydrides**.<br>2Na(s) + H₂(g) → 2NaH(s)<br>Ca(s) + H₂(g) → CaH₂(s) | **Hydrides of non-metals are stable compounds** and are **formed by sharing of electrons**.<br>N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)<br>H₂(g) + S(s) → H₂S(g) |

## 📝 Example 4

**Question:** Pratyush took sulphur powder on a spatula and heated it. He collected the gas evolved by inverting a test tube over it.

(a) What will be the action of gas on
   - (i) dry litmus paper?
   - (ii) moist litmus paper?

(b) Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction taking place.

<img src="../images/mnm-fig9-heating-sulfur.png" alt="Heating sulphur powder experiment setup" width="50%"/>

*Figure: Experimental setup showing heating of sulphur powder on a spatula with gas collection*

**Solution:**

(a) Upon heating, sulphur burns in air to form **sulphur dioxide (SO₂) gas**.

   **(i) Dry litmus paper:** There is **no change** because sulphur dioxide gas does not affect dry litmus paper.

   **(ii) Moist litmus paper:** The gas turns **blue litmus red** due to the formation of acidic sulphurous acid.

(b) The balanced chemical equation is:

\\[
\\text{S}(s) + \\text{O}_2(g) \\longrightarrow \\text{SO}_2(g)
\\]

\\[
\\text{SO}_2(g) + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\longrightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{SO}_3(aq)
\\]
