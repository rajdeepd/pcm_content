# Corrosion of Metals

## What is Corrosion?

### Definition

- Gradual deterioration of metals due to reaction with environment
- Surface of metal is converted into oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, etc.
- Unwanted and damaging process

### Examples

- Rusting of iron
- Green coating on copper (basic copper carbonate)
- Black coating on silver (silver sulfide)
- Tarnishing of other metals

## Rusting of Iron

### Process

- Most common form of corrosion
- Iron reacts with oxygen and moisture in air
- Forms hydrated iron(III) oxide: Fe₂O₃.xH₂O

### Chemical Reactions

1. Iron reacts with oxygen (oxidation)
   - 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

2. In presence of moisture
   - Fe₂O₃ + xH₂O → Fe₂O₃.xH₂O (rust)

### Conditions Necessary for Rusting

1. Presence of oxygen (air)
2. Presence of water (moisture)
3. Both conditions must be present simultaneously

## Factors Affecting Corrosion

1. **Moisture** - Increases rate of corrosion
2. **Presence of salts** - Accelerates corrosion (e.g., near sea)
3. **Impurities in metal** - More impurities, faster corrosion
4. **Temperature** - Higher temperature increases rate
5. **pH of environment** - Acidic conditions accelerate corrosion

## Prevention of Corrosion

### Methods to Prevent Corrosion

1. **Painting**
   - Prevents contact with air and moisture
   - Common for iron articles

2. **Oiling and Greasing**
   - Temporary protection
   - Used for machinery parts

3. **Galvanization**
   - Coating iron with zinc
   - Zinc acts as sacrificial metal
   - Most effective method

4. **Electroplating**
   - Coating with non-corrosive metal (chromium, nickel, etc.)
   - Decorative and protective

5. **Alloying**
   - Making alloys (stainless steel)
   - Intrinsically resistant to corrosion

6. **Tin plating**
   - Coating iron with tin
   - Used for food containers

### Sacrificial Protection

- More reactive metal corrodes preferentially
- Protects the less reactive metal
- Example: Zinc coating in galvanization
