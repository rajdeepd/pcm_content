# Bonding in Metals and Non-metals

## Ionic Bonding

### Formation of Ionic Bonds

- Formed by transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal
- Metal loses electrons to form positive ions (cations)
- Non-metal gains electrons to form negative ions (anions)
- Electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions

### Electron Transfer

- Metals have 1, 2, or 3 valence electrons
- Non-metals have 5, 6, or 7 valence electrons
- Transfer helps both achieve stable octet configuration

## Ionic Compounds

### Properties of Ionic Compounds

1. **Physical state** - Solid at room temperature
2. **Melting and boiling points** - High due to strong ionic bonds
3. **Solubility** - Generally soluble in water
4. **Conductivity** 
   - Do not conduct electricity in solid state
   - Conduct electricity in molten state or aqueous solution
5. **Brittleness** - Brittle in nature

### Formation of Ionic Compounds

#### Example 1: Sodium chloride (NaCl)
- Na → Na⁺ + e⁻
- Cl + e⁻ → Cl⁻
- Na⁺ + Cl⁻ → NaCl

#### Example 2: Magnesium oxide (MgO)

- Mg → Mg²⁺ + 2e⁻
- O + 2e⁻ → O²⁻
- Mg²⁺ + O²⁻ → MgO

## Examples

- Common ionic compounds: NaCl, MgO, CaCl₂, KBr
- Properties explained by ionic bond nature
