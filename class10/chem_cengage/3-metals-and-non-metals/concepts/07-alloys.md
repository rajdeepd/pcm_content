# Alloys

## What are Alloys?

### Definition

- Homogeneous mixture of two or more metals
- Or mixture of metal(s) with non-metal(s)
- Properties different from constituent metals
- Prepared by mixing metals in molten state and cooling

### Purpose of Making Alloys

1. Enhance strength and hardness
2. Increase resistance to corrosion
3. Lower melting point
4. Modify color and appearance
5. Improve other physical/chemical properties

## Properties of Alloys

### General Properties

- Usually harder than pure metals
- More resistant to corrosion
- Different melting points than constituent metals
- May have different electrical conductivity
- Retain metallic lustre

## Common Alloys and Their Uses

### Iron-based Alloys

**Steel**
- Composition: Iron + Carbon (0.1-2%)
- Properties: Strong, hard, versatile
- Uses: Construction, machinery, tools, automobiles

**Stainless Steel**
- Composition: Iron + Chromium + Nickel + Carbon
- Properties: Rust-resistant, strong, lustrous
- Uses: Utensils, surgical instruments, industrial equipment

### Copper-based Alloys

**Brass**
- Composition: Copper (60-80%) + Zinc (20-40%)
- Properties: Golden color, malleable, corrosion-resistant
- Uses: Decorative items, musical instruments, coins

**Bronze**
- Composition: Copper (80-90%) + Tin (10-20%)
- Properties: Hard, corrosion-resistant
- Uses: Statues, medals, bells, bearings

### Other Important Alloys

**Solder**
- Composition: Lead + Tin
- Properties: Low melting point
- Uses: Welding electrical wires, joining metals

**Amalgam**
- Composition: Mercury + other metal(s)
- Properties: Soft, moldable
- Uses: Dental fillings

**Duralumin**
- Composition: Aluminum + Copper + Magnesium + Manganese
- Properties: Strong, light, corrosion-resistant
- Uses: Aircraft construction, automobile parts

**Alnico**
- Composition: Aluminum + Nickel + Cobalt + Iron
- Properties: Strong magnetic properties
- Uses: Making magnets

## Comparison: Pure Metals vs Alloys

| Property | Pure Metal | Alloy |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Strength | Less strong | More strong |
| Hardness | Softer | Harder |
| Melting point | Fixed | Lower/Different |
| Corrosion resistance | Less resistant | More resistant |
| Cost | May be expensive | Usually more economical |

## Advantages of Alloys

1. Improved mechanical properties
2. Better corrosion resistance
3. Cost-effective
4. Tailored properties for specific applications
5. Enhanced durability
