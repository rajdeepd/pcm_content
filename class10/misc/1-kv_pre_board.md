## Answers

17_ (b) Displacement reaction.  
18_ (d) Hydrochloric acid and sulphuric acid.  
19_ (b) $\mathrm{a}-$ (iii), $\mathrm{b}-$ (i), $\mathrm{c}-$ (iv), $\mathrm{d}-$ (ii).  
20_ (c) Mercury and Bromine.  
21_ (a) pH of acetic acid is more than that of hydrochloric acid.   
22_ $Ca(OH)_2 + CO_2 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + H_2O$.   
   To understand why the milkiness disappears when excess carbon dioxide is passed into lime water, we can break down the process into a few clear steps:   
  
   $\mathrm{CaCO}_3+\mathrm{CO}_2+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ca}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_3\right)_2$

  Calcium hydrogen carbonate is soluble in water.
  Disappearance of Milkiness: As calcium hydrogen carbonate is formed, it dissolves in the water, leading to the disappearance of the white precipitate of calcium carbonate. This results in the milkiness of the lime water vanishing.   
  The milkiness in lime water disappears upon the addition of excess carbon dioxide because the insoluble calcium carbonate is converted into soluble calcium hydrogen carbonate.  
23_ 3 and 3 between carbon atoms.  
24_ (c) A is true but R is false.   
25_ Not enough number of carbon atoms   
26_ **Attempt either option A or B.**
 **A.**. 
    (i) **Anode:** Oxygen ($O_2$); **Cathode:** Hydrogen ($H_2$).
    (ii) Distilled water is a covalent compound and does not contain free ions to conduct electricity.
    (iii) A few drops of acid (like $H_2SO_4$) or a salt.

 **OR**

**B.**. 
    (i) Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in the air to form a green coating of basic copper carbonate ($CuCO_3 \cdot Cu(OH)_2$), known as verdigris.     
    (ii) No, iron is more reactive and rusts (corrodes) easily, leading to structural damage. Copper's corrosion forms a protective layer.      
    (iii) Copper is malleable, ductile, and resistant to corrosion (forms a protective layer), making it durable for domes.      

27_ (i) Suggest a safe procedure of diluting a strong concentrated acid.  
(ii) Name the salt formed when sulphuric acid is added to sodium hydroxide and write its oH .   
(iii) Dry HCl gas does not change the colour of dry blue litmus paper.   Why?  

  Slowly add water to the acid while stirring continuously.  
  $H_2SO_4 + 2NaOH \rightarrow Na_2SO_4 + 2H_2O$.   
  $Na_2SO_4 \rightarrow Na^+ + SO_4^{2-}$

  Dry HCl gas does not change the colour of dry blue litmus paper.   Why?  
  Dry HCl gas does not change the color of dry blue litmus paper because it requires the presence of water to dissociate and produce hydrogen ions ($H^{+}$). Acids show acidic properties and affect litmus paper only in an aqueous solution, not as a dry gas. 

28_ (i) Copper (ii) $CuSO_4$ (iii) Copper gets refined when electric current is passed in the electrolytic cell.
  Step 1
    a) In the refining of copper by electrolytic refining, the anode is made of impure copper, and the cathode is made of pure copper.

   Step 2
    b) The solution used in the process is called copper(II) sulfate solution, and its formula is CuSO4.

 Step 3
    c) When electric current is passed through the electrolytic cell, copper ions (Cu²⁺) from the copper(II) sulfate solution are reduced at the cathode, depositing pure copper. At the anode, the impure copper oxidizes, releasing Cu²⁺ ions into the solution, thus maintaining the concentration of copper ions in the solution.

 Name of compound. Ethanol, Molecular formula $-\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_5 \mathrm{OH}$
Heating ethanol at 443 K with excess conc. sulphuric acid ( $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4$ ) results in the dehydration of ethanol to give ethene.

$
\mathrm{CH}_3-\mathrm{CH}_2-\mathrm{OH} \xrightarrow{\text { Conc. } \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4} \mathrm{CH}_2=\mathrm{CH}_2+\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}

Symptoms include blurry distance vision, squinting, eye strain, and headaches, typically starting in childhood and progressing through adolescence, though increased screen time and less outdoor activity are driving a global rise, especially in children.

38_ (a) **Principal Focus of Concave Mirror:** A point on the principal axis where rays of light incident parallel to the principal axis converge after reflection.
    (b) **Radius of Curvature:**
    The ray passes through the focus, so focal length $f = 10$ cm.
    Radius of curvature $R = 2f = 2 \times 10 = 20$ cm.
    (c) **Image Position:**
    Convex mirror: $u = -10$ cm, $f = +15$ cm.   
    $\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$.   
    $\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{15}$.   
    $\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}$.  
    $v = +6$ cm.   
    The image is formed 6 cm behind the mirror (Virtual and Erect).

38_ The mirror is a convex mirror. A convex mirror always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image of an object, regardless of the object's position.

39_   In a house, 2 bulbs of 50 W each are used for 6 hours daily and an electric geyser of 1 kW is used for 1 hour daily. Calculate the total energy consumed in a month of 30 days

    100w x 6 = 600wh.   
    1000wh,   
    1600x30 wh = 1.6 kwh.  
    Cost = 1.6 x 8 = ₹ 12.80.
