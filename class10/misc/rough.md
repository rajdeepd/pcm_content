32. Assertion (A): The rainbow is a natural spectrum of sunlight in the sky.
Reason (R): Rainbow is formed in the sky when the sun is overhead and water droplets are also present in air.

**Answer:**
(c) A is true but R is false.

**Explanation:**
*   **Assertion:** True. A rainbow is indeed a natural spectrum produced by the dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets present in the atmosphere.
*   **Reason:** False. A rainbow is formed when the sun is **behind** the observer, not overhead. If the sun is overhead, the conditions for total internal reflection and dispersion to form a visible rainbow for the observer are not met in the same way.

33. The above figure shows the formation of an image by a lens shown by a thick line.
Analyse the figure and answer the following questions.  
(i) What is the type of lens used?   
(ii) What is the nature of the image?   
(iii) If the image is formed at a distance of 30 cm from the lens and the
image is twice the size of the object, then where is the object placed?

**Answer:**
(i) **Convex Lens**. (Since the image is enlarged, magnification $|m| > 1$. A concave lens always forms a diminished image).
(ii) **Virtual and Erect**. (An enlarged image formed by a convex lens can be virtual or real. Assuming the standard case often depicted with "thick lines" or based on the user's previous context of "between focus and pole", it's likely virtual. If it were real, it would be inverted).
(iii) **Object Position:** 15 cm.
*   Given: Image distance $|v| = 30$ cm, Magnification $|m| = 2$.
*   $m = v/u$.
*   If Virtual: $v = -30$ cm, $m = +2$. $u = -30/2 = -15$ cm.
*   If Real: $v = +30$ cm, $m = -2$. $u = 30/(-2) = -15$ cm.
*   In both cases, the object is placed at **15 cm** from the lens.
