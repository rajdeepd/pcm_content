1. **(i) (a) and (b)**
   **Explanation:**
   - (a) Lead is getting reduced: Incorrect. Lead oxide (PbO) is getting reduced to Lead (Pb).
   - (b) Carbon dioxide is getting oxidised: Incorrect. Carbon (C) is getting oxidised to Carbon dioxide (CO2).
   - (c) Carbon is getting oxidised: Correct.
   - (d) Lead oxide is getting reduced: Correct.
   Therefore, the incorrect statements are (a) and (b).

2. **(d) displacement reaction**
   **Explanation:**
   In this reaction, Aluminium (Al) displaces Iron (Fe) from Iron(III) oxide ($\mathrm{Fe}_2 \mathrm{O}_3$) because Aluminium is more reactive than Iron. Hence, it is a displacement reaction.

3. **(a) Hydrogen gas and iron chloride are produced.**
   **Explanation:**
   When dilute hydrochloric acid reacts with iron, iron(II) chloride and hydrogen gas are formed. The reaction is:
   $ \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{s}) + 2\mathrm{HCl}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{FeCl}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) $

4. **Balanced Chemical Equation:**
   A balanced chemical equation is an equation in which the number of atoms of each element remains the same on both the reactant and product sides.

   **Why should chemical equations be balanced?**
   Chemical equations should be balanced to satisfy the **Law of Conservation of Mass**, which states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. This means the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of the products, implying the number of atoms of each element must be conserved.

9. What does one mean by exothermic and endothermic reactions? Give examples.
10. Why is respiration considered an exothermic reaction? Explain.|
11. Why are decomposition reactions called the opposite of combination reactions? Write equations for these reactions.

9. **Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions:**
   - **Exothermic Reactions:** Reactions in which heat is released along with the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions.
     **Example:** Burning of natural gas.
     $ \mathrm{CH}_4(\mathrm{g}) + 2\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g}) + \text{Heat} $
   - **Endothermic Reactions:** Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
     **Example:** Decomposition of calcium carbonate.
     $ \mathrm{CaCO}_3(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} \mathrm{CaO}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{g}) $

10. **Respiration as an Exothermic Reaction:**
    Respiration is considered an exothermic reaction because energy is released during the process. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler substances like glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration.
    $ \mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{H}_{12}\mathrm{O}_6(\mathrm{aq}) + 6\mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow 6\mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{aq}) + 6\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) + \text{Energy} $

11. **Decomposition vs. Combination Reactions:**
    - **Decomposition reactions** are those in which a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products.
    - **Combination reactions** are those in which two or more reactants combine to form a single product.
    Thus, decomposition reactions are opposite to combination reactions.   
    **Example of Decomposition Reaction:**
    $ 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \xrightarrow{\text{Electricity}} 2\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) $. 
    **Example of Combination Reaction:**
    $ 2\mathrm{H}_2(\mathrm{g}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \rightarrow 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) $

15. **Precipitation Reaction:**
    Any reaction that produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction. A precipitate is an insoluble substance formed during a reaction.

    **Example:**
    When sodium sulphate solution is mixed with barium chloride solution, a white substance, which is insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance is barium sulphate.

    **Activity:**
    - Take about 3 mL of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube.
    - In another test tube, take about 3 mL of barium chloride solution.
    - Mix the two solutions.
    - You will observe that a white substance, which is insoluble in water, is formed.

    **Equation:**
    $ \mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{BaCl}_2(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{BaSO}_4(\mathrm{s}) + 2 \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{aq}) $

    Another example

    **Reaction of Potassium Iodide with Lead Nitrate**:

    To solve the question regarding the reaction of potassium iodide with lead nitrate, we can follow these steps:

    1. **Identify the Reactants:** The two reactants in the reaction are potassium iodide (KI) and lead(II) nitrate ($\mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_2$).

    2. **Write the Chemical Equation:** When potassium iodide reacts with lead(II) nitrate, the reaction can be represented as:
       $ 2\mathrm{KI} + \mathrm{Pb}(\mathrm{NO}_3)_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{PbI}_2 + 2\mathrm{KNO}_3 $

       Here, lead(II) iodide ($\mathrm{PbI}_2$) and potassium nitrate ($\mathrm{KNO}_3$) are the products.

    3. **Identify the Precipitate:** In this reaction, lead(II) iodide ($\mathrm{PbI}_2$) is formed as a precipitate. It is important to note that $\mathrm{PbI}_2$ is known for its characteristic yellow color.

    4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the yellow precipitate formed when potassium iodide reacts with lead(II) nitrate is lead(II) iodide ($\mathrm{PbI}_2$).

    **Final Answer:**
    The yellow precipitate formed is lead(II) iodide ($\mathrm{PbI}_2$).



16. Explain the following in terms of gain or loss of oxygen with two examples each.
(a) Oxidation

    $ \mathrm{Cu} + \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{CuO} $   
    $ \mathrm{Zn} + \mathrm{O}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{ZnO} $  

    **Another example (Loss of Hydrogen):**
    $ \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{S} + \mathrm{Cl}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{S} + 2\mathrm{HCl} $
    (Here, Hydrogen sulphide is oxidised to Sulphur)

(b) Reduction.   

   $ \mathrm{CuO} + \mathrm{H}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} $      
   $ \mathrm{ZnO} + \mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zn} + \mathrm{CO} $

17. A shiny brown coloured element ' X ' on heating in air becomes black in colour. Name the element ' X ' and the black coloured compound formed.
    **Heating of Shiny Brown Element 'X':**
    - **Element 'X':** The shiny brown coloured element is **Copper (Cu)**.
    - **Black Coloured Compound:** On heating in air, it forms a black coloured compound called **Copper(II) oxide (CuO)**.
    - **Reaction:**
      $ 2\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{g}) \xrightarrow{\text{Heat}} 2\mathrm{CuO}(\mathrm{s}) $
      (Shiny brown) $\quad$ (Black)

18. Why do we apply paint on iron articles?
    **Answer:**
    Paint covers the surface of iron articles and cuts off the contact of iron with air (oxygen) and moisture. Since air and moisture are essential for rusting, painting prevents rusting of iron.
19. Oil and fat containing food items are flushed with nitrogen. Why?
    **Answer:**
    Nitrogen is an inert gas and does not easily react with these substances. On the other hand, oxygen reacts with food substances and makes them rancid. Thus, bags used in packing food items are flushed with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen inside the pack. When oxygen is not present inside the pack, rancidity of oil and fat containing food items is avoided.
20. Explain the following terms with one example each.
(a) Corrosion
(b) Rancidity

    **Answer:**
    (a) **Corrosion:**
    Corrosion is the process in which metals are eaten up gradually by the action of air, moisture, or a chemical (such as an acid) on their surface.
    *Example:* Rusting of iron is the most common example of corrosion. When an iron article remains exposed to moist air for a long time, its surface is covered with a brown flaky substance called rust.

    (b) **Rancidity:**
    The condition produced by aerial oxidation of fats and oils in foods marked by unpleasant smell and taste is called rancidity.
    *Example:* When butter is kept open for a long time, its smell and taste change.

**Activity:**
- Take four beakers and label them as A, B, C and D.
- Put 25 mL of water in A, B and C beakers and copper sulphate solution in beaker D.
- Measure and record the temperature of each liquid contained in the beakers above.

  $ \mathrm{K}_2\mathrm{SO}_4(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\text{water}} 2\mathrm{K}^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{SO}_4^{2-}(\mathrm{aq}) $
- **Beaker B (Ammonium Nitrate + Water):** Endothermic reaction (Temperature falls).
  $ \mathrm{NH}_4\mathrm{NO}_3(\mathrm{s}) \xrightarrow{\text{water}} \mathrm{NH}_4^+(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{NO}_3^-(\mathrm{aq}) $
- **Beaker C (Anhydrous Copper Sulphate + Water):** Exothermic reaction (Temperature rises).
  $ \mathrm{CuSO}_4(\mathrm{s}) + 5\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{l}) \rightarrow \mathrm{CuSO}_4 \cdot 5\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s}) $
- **Beaker D (Iron Fillings + Copper Sulphate Solution):** Exothermic reaction (Temperature rises due to displacement reaction).
  $ \mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{s}) + \mathrm{CuSO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{FeSO}_4(\mathrm{aq}) + \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{s}) $
