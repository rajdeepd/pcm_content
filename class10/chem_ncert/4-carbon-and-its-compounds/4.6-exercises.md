## Answers

### MCQ Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | (b) 7 covalent bonds |
| 2 | (c) ketone |
| 3 | (b) the fuel is not burning completely |

### Short Answer Answers

**4. Covalent Bond in $CH_3Cl$:**

- **Bond Type:** Covalent Bond (formed by sharing electrons)
- **Formation:**
  - Carbon (4 valence electrons) shares 3 electrons with 3 Hydrogen atoms
  - Carbon shares 1 electron with 1 Chlorine atom
  - Each hydrogen atom shares 1 electron with Carbon
  - Chlorine shares 1 electron with Carbon

**6. Homologous Series:**

A homologous series is a group of organic compounds with:
- The same functional group
- Similar chemical properties
- Each successive member differs by a single $CH_2$ unit

**Example:** The alkanes are a homologous series with the general formula $C_nH_{2n+2}$:

| Name | Formula | Difference |
|------|---------|------------|
| Methane | $CH_4$ | - |
| Ethane | $C_2H_6$ | +$CH_2$ |
| Propane | $C_3H_8$ | +$CH_2$ |
| Butane | $C_4H_{10}$ | +$CH_2$ |

**7. Differentiating Ethanol and Ethanoic Acid:**

| Feature | Ethanol | Ethanoic Acid |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Class** | Alcohol | Carboxylic Acid |
| **Functional Group** | -OH (hydroxyl) | -COOH (carboxyl) |
| **Smell** | Pleasant | Pungent, vinegar-like |
| **Acidity** | Not acidic | Weakly acidic |
| **Reaction with Bases** | No reaction with carbonates | Reacts with carbonates to produce $CO_2$ |
| **Boiling Point** | 78.2°C (351 K) | 118°C (390 K) |
| **State at room temp** | Liquid | Liquid (melts at 16°C) |
