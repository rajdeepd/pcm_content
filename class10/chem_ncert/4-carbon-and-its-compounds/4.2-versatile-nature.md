# 4.2 Versatile Nature of Carbon

Carbon forms millions of compounds, outnumbering those formed by all other elements put together. This is due to two factors:

---

## 1. Catenation

Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules.

- This property is called **catenation** and allows for long chains, branched chains, or rings of carbon atoms.
- **Saturated Compounds:** Compounds linked by only single bonds between carbon atoms.
- **Unsaturated Compounds:** Compounds having double or triple bonds between carbon atoms.
- The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and stable, unlike other elements like silicon which form reactive compounds with hydrogen chains of only up to seven or eight atoms.

---

## 2. Tetravalency

Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of other monovalent elements.

- Carbon forms compounds with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine, and many other elements.
- The bonds are strong because the small size of the carbon atom enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly.

## Types of Carbon Compounds

### Saturated Hydrocarbons (Alkanes)

Examples include:
- Methane ($CH_4$)
- Ethane ($C_2H_6$)
- Propane ($C_3H_8$)

These are normally not very reactive.

### Table 4.2: Formulae and Structures of Saturated Hydrocarbons

| No. of C atoms | Name | Formula |
|----------------|------|---------|
| 1 | Methane | $CH_4$ |
| 2 | Ethane | $C_2H_6$ |
| 3 | Propane | $C_3H_8$ |
| 4 | Butane | $C_4H_{10}$ |
| 5 | Pentane | $C_5H_{12}$ |
| 6 | Hexane | $C_6H_{14}$ |

### Unsaturated Hydrocarbons

| Type | Bond | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **Alkenes** | Double bond | Ethene ($C_2H_4$) |
| **Alkynes** | Triple bond | Ethyne ($C_2H_2$) |

### Structural Isomers

Compounds with identical molecular formulas but different structures.

**Example:** Butane ($C_4H_{10}$) has straight and branched carbon skeletons.

### Cyclic Compounds

Carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring.

**Examples:**
- Cyclohexane ($C_6H_{12}$)
- Benzene ($C_6H_6$)

## Functional Groups

Heteroatoms (like chlorine or oxygen) can replace hydrogen in a hydrocarbon chain, conferring specific properties to the compound regardless of the chain length.

| Class of Compounds | Functional Group |
|:---|:---|
| **Halo alkane** | $-Cl, -Br$ |
| **Alcohol** | $-OH$ |
| **Aldehyde** | $-CHO$ |
| **Ketone** | $-CO-$ |
| **Carboxylic acid** | $-COOH$ |

## Homologous Series

A homologous series is a series of compounds in which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain.

- Successive members differ by a $-CH_2-$ unit and **14 u** in molecular mass.
- **General Formula for Alkenes:** $C_nH_{2n}$
- As molecular mass increases, physical properties (like melting and boiling points) show a gradation, but chemical properties remain similar.

---

## Nomenclature

Names of compounds are based on the carbon chain length modified by a prefix or suffix indicating the functional group.

### Rules:

1. Identify the number of carbon atoms (e.g., 3 carbons = Propane)
2. If a functional group is present, modify the name with a prefix or suffix (e.g., Ketone suffix is 'one' → Propanone)
3. If unsaturated, change 'ane' to 'ene' (double bond) or 'yne' (triple bond)
