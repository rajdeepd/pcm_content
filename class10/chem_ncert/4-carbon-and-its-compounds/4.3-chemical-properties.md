# 4.3 Chemical Properties of Carbon Compounds

---

## 1. Combustion

Carbon and its compounds burn in oxygen to give carbon dioxide, heat, and light.

$C + O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + \text{heat and light}$

$CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O + \text{heat and light}$

$C_2H_6 + 3O_2 \rightarrow 2CO_2 + 3H_2O + \text{heat and light}$

| Type of Hydrocarbon | Flame Produced |
|---------------------|----------------|
| **Saturated** | Clean blue flame |
| **Unsaturated** | Yellow flame with black smoke |

> **Note:** Limiting the air supply can cause incomplete combustion of saturated hydrocarbons, producing a sooty flame.

### Activity 4.3

**CAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher's assistance.**

**Procedure:**
- Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene, camphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and burn them.
- Observe the nature of the flame and note whether smoke is produced.
- Place a metal plate above the flame.

**Observations:**

| Compound | Flame Type | Smoke | Deposition |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Alcohol (Ethanol) | Clean blue flame | No smoke | No deposition |
| Naphthalene | Yellow, sooty flame | Black smoke | Black soot deposit |
| Camphor | Yellow, sooty flame | Black smoke | Black soot deposit |

**Conclusion:**
- Saturated compounds generally burn with a clean flame.
- Unsaturated or aromatic compounds burn with a yellow flame with lots of black smoke.

## 2. Oxidation

Carbon compounds can be easily oxidised on combustion. Alcohols can be converted to carboxylic acids using oxidising agents like alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate.

$CH_3CH_2OH \xrightarrow{\text{Alkaline } KMnO_4 + \text{Heat}} CH_3COOH$

(Ethanol → Ethanoic acid)

## 3. Addition Reaction

Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons.

$R_2C=CR_2 \xrightarrow{Ni \text{ catalyst}} R_2CH-CHR_2$

**Applications:**
- This reaction is used in the **hydrogenation of vegetable oils** using a nickel catalyst.
- Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains (healthy)
- Animal fats have saturated carbon chains (harmful in excess)

## 4. Substitution Reaction

In the presence of sunlight, chlorine can replace hydrogen atoms in saturated hydrocarbons one by one.

$CH_4 + Cl_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Sunlight}} CH_3Cl + HCl$

Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction.

## Activity 4.4

**Procedure:**
- Light a Bunsen burner and adjust the air hole at the base to get different types of flames.

**Observations:**

| Air Hole Position | Flame Type | Reason |
|-------------------|-----------|--------|
| **Closed** | Yellow, sooty flame | Limited oxygen → incomplete combustion |
| **Open** | Blue flame | Sufficient oxygen → complete combustion |

## Summary Table

| Reaction | Reactants | Products | Catalyst/Conditions |
|----------|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| Combustion | Hydrocarbon + $O_2$ | $CO_2$ + $H_2O$ + Heat | - |
| Oxidation | Alcohol | Carboxylic acid | Alkaline $KMnO_4$ / Heat |
| Addition | Unsaturated HC + $H_2$ | Saturated HC | Ni or Pd catalyst |
| Substitution | Saturated HC + $Cl_2$ | Chlorinated HC + HCl | Sunlight |
