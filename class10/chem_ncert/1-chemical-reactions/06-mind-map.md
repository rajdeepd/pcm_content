# 1.6 Mind Map

- Balanced equations: equal atoms of each element on both sides.  
- Steps to balance (hit-and-trial): write skeletal → list atoms → balance successive elements → verify counts.
- Chemical equations: symbolic representation with reactants → products.
- Characteristics of reactions: change in state/colour, gas evolution, temperature change, precipitate.
- Types of reactions: combination, decomposition (thermal/electrolytic/photolytic), displacement, double displacement, exothermic/endothermic, redox.
- Oxidation/reduction: addition/removal of oxygen or hydrogen; occur together in redox.  
- Effects of oxidation: corrosion; rancidity; prevention via coatings, airtight storage, antioxidants.
