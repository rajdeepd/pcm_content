# 1.1 Introduction

## Chemical Reactions
- A chemical reaction changes one or more reactants into products with new properties because old bonds break and new bonds form.
- Reactants are the starting substances; products are the substances formed.
- Example: Burning magnesium ribbon gives magnesium oxide (white powder) from magnesium and oxygen.

### Characteristics of Chemical Reactions
- Change in state
- Change in colour
- Evolution of gas
- Change in temperature
- Formation of a precipitate

## Chemical Equations
- Word equation example: Methane + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water.
- Symbolic form (chemical equation):  
  $ \text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \longrightarrow \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $
- Reactants are written on the left, products on the right, separated by an arrow (→).

### Writing a Chemical Equation
- List reactants with plus signs on the left.
- List products with plus signs on the right.
- Arrow points toward products; conditions (e.g., Δ for heat) may be written above the arrow.
- Example with heat:  
  $ \text{CH}_4 + \text{O}_2 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{CO}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O} $
