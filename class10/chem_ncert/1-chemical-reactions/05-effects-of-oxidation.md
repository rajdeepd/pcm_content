# 1.5 Effects of Oxidation in Everyday Life

## Corrosion
- Slow eating away of metals by air, water, or chemicals (e.g., rusting of iron).  
- Effects: structural damage to vehicles, bridges, railings, ships, etc.  
- Prevention: painting, galvanising, electroplating, oiling/greasing.

## Rancidity
- Slow oxidation of fats and oils in food, causing bad taste and smell.  
- Prevention: airtight containers, refrigeration, flushing with nitrogen, adding antioxidants.
