# Chapter 2: Acids, Bases and Salts

You have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy – lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?

- Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of acids and bases to nullify each other's effect.
- Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting them.

You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.

In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other's effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.

## Indicators

### What are Indicators?

Indicators are substances that show different colours in acidic and basic solutions. They help us identify whether a substance is an acid or a base.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Natural Indicators** | Litmus, Turmeric, Red cabbage leaves, Coloured petals of flowers (Hydrangea, Petunia, Geranium) |
| **Synthetic Indicators** | Methyl orange, Phenolphthalein |
| **Olfactory Indicators** | Onion, Vanilla, Clove oil |

> **Do You Know?**
> 
> Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple.

## Summary of Indicator Colour Changes

| Indicator | In Acid | In Base |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Blue Litmus** | Turns Red | No change |
| **Red Litmus** | No change | Turns Blue |
| **Phenolphthalein** | Colourless | Pink |
| **Methyl Orange** | Red/Pink | Yellow |
| **Turmeric** | Yellow | Reddish-brown |

## Question

1. You have been provided with three test tubes. One of them contains distilled water and the other two contain an acidic solution and a basic solution, respectively. If you are given only red litmus paper, how will you identify the contents of each test tube?

### Answer
[cite_start]Based on the principles found in the text[cite: 509], here is the step-by-step approach to identify the contents of the three test tubes using only red litmus paper:

**1. Identify the Base**
* Dip the **red litmus paper** into each of the three test tubes.
* [cite_start]The solution that turns the red litmus paper **blue** is the **Basic solution** (Bases change the colour of red litmus to blue [cite: 509]).
* *Note:* The litmus paper will remain red in the other two test tubes (acid and distilled water).

**2. Prepare for the Next Step**
* You now have a piece of **blue litmus paper** (the one that changed colour in the previous step).
* You have two unidentified test tubes left: one is Acidic and one is Distilled Water.

**3. Identify the Acid**
* Dip the newly formed **blue litmus paper** into the remaining two test tubes.
* [cite_start]The solution that turns the blue litmus paper back to **red** is the **Acidic solution** (Acids change the colour of blue litmus to red [cite: 509]).

**4. Identify the Distilled Water**
* The remaining test tube is **Distilled Water**.
* *Verification:* Distilled water is neutral, so it would not have changed the colour of the original red litmus paper (in Step 1) nor the blue litmus paper (in Step 3).
