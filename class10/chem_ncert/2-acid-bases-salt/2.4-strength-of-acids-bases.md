# 2.3 How Strong Are Acid or Base Solutions?

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt about dilution and decrease in concentration of $H^{+}$ or $OH^{-}$ ions in solutions.

Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?

## The pH Scale

We can measure hydrogen ion concentration by using a **universal indicator**, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.

A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called **pH scale** has been developed.

> **Note:** The 'p' in pH stands for 'potenz' in German, meaning **power**.

### pH Scale Range

| pH Value | Nature |
|----------|--------|
| 0 | Very acidic |
| 7 | Neutral |
| 14 | Very alkaline |

**Key Points:**
- Higher the hydronium ion concentration, **lower** is the pH value.
- The pH of a neutral solution is **7**.
- Values **less than 7** represent an **acidic** solution.
- Values **greater than 7** represent a **basic/alkaline** solution.

Generally, paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.

## Activity 2.11 - Testing pH Values

Test the pH values of the following solutions:

**Table 2.2**

| S. No. | Solution | Colour of pH paper | Approximate pH value | Nature of substance |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Saliva (before meal) | | | |
| 2 | Saliva (after meal) | | | |
| 3 | Lemon juice | | | |
| 4 | Colourless aerated drink | | | |
| 5 | Carrot juice | | | |
| 6 | Coffee | | | |
| 7 | Tomato juice | | | |
| 8 | Tap water | | | |
| 9 | 1M NaOH | | | |
| 10 | 1M HCl | | | |

## Strong and Weak Acids/Bases

The strength of acids and bases depends on the number of $H^{+}$ ions and $OH^{-}$ ions produced, respectively.

If we take hydrochloric acid and acetic acid of the same concentration (say one molar), they produce different amounts of hydrogen ions.

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Strong Acid** | Gives rise to more $H^{+}$ ions | HCl, $H_2SO_4$, $HNO_3$ |
| **Weak Acid** | Gives less $H^{+}$ ions | $CH_3COOH$ (Acetic acid) |
| **Strong Base** | Gives rise to more $OH^{-}$ ions | NaOH, KOH |
| **Weak Base** | Gives less $OH^{-}$ ions | $NH_4OH$, $Mg(OH)_2$ |

## 2.3.1 Importance of pH in Everyday Life

### Are plants and animals pH sensitive?

Our body works within the **pH range of 7.0 to 7.8**. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change.

**Acid Rain:**
- When pH of rain water is **less than 5.6**, it is called acid rain.
- When acid rain flows into rivers, it lowers the pH of river water.
- The survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult.

> **Do You Know?**
> 
> **Acids in other planets**
> The atmosphere of Venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of sulphuric acid. Do you think life can exist on this planet?

### pH of Soil

Plants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth.

#### Activity 2.12

- Put about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.
- Shake the contents and filter.
- Check the pH of this filtrate with universal indicator paper.

This helps determine the ideal soil pH for plant growth in your region.

### pH in Our Digestive System

Our stomach produces **hydrochloric acid** which helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.

**Indigestion:**
- During indigestion, the stomach produces too much acid
- This causes pain and irritation
- People use bases called **antacids** to get relief
- Antacids neutralise the excess acid

**Example:** Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this purpose.

### pH Change as the Cause of Tooth Decay

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Critical pH** | Tooth decay starts when pH of mouth is **lower than 5.5** |
| **Tooth enamel** | Made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (crystalline form of calcium phosphate) |
| **Property** | Hardest substance in the body; does not dissolve in water |
| **Corrosion** | Enamel is corroded when pH in the mouth is below 5.5 |

**Cause:** Bacteria in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after eating.

**Prevention:**
- Clean the mouth after eating food
- Use toothpastes (which are generally basic) to neutralise the excess acid

### Self Defence by Animals and Plants

**Bee Sting:**
- Leaves an acid which causes pain and irritation
- Use of a mild base like **baking soda** on the stung area gives relief

**Nettle Leaves:**
- Stinging hair inject **methanoic acid** causing burning pain

> **Do You Know?**
> 
> **Nature provides neutralisation options**
> Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair which cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic acid secreted by them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the area with the leaf of the **dock plant**, which often grows beside the nettle in the wild.

## Table 2.3: Some Naturally Occurring Acids

| Natural source | Acid | Natural source | Acid |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Vinegar | Acetic acid | Sour milk (Curd) | Lactic acid |
| Orange | Citric acid | Lemon | Citric acid |
| Tamarind | Tartaric acid | Ant sting | Methanoic acid |
| Tomato | Oxalic acid | Nettle sting | Methanoic acid |

## Questions

1. You have two solutions, A and B. The pH of solution A is 6 and pH of solution B is 8. Which solution has more hydrogen ion concentration? Which of this is acidic and which one is basic?
2. What effect does the concentration of $H^{+}(aq)$ ions have on the nature of the solution?
3. Do basic solutions also have $H^{+}(aq)$ ions? If yes, then why are these basic?
4. Under what soil condition do you think a farmer would treat the soil of his fields with quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or chalk (calcium carbonate)?
