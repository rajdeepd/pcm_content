# What You Have Learnt

## Key Points Summary

| Topic | Key Learning |
|-------|--------------|
| **Indicators** | Acid-base indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the presence of acids and bases |
| **Acidic Nature** | Due to the formation of $H^{+}(aq)$ ions in solution |
| **Basic Nature** | Due to the formation of $OH^{-}(aq)$ ions in solution |

---

## Reactions of Acids and Bases

| Reaction | Products |
|----------|----------|
| Acid + Metal | Hydrogen gas + Salt |
| Base + Metal | Hydrogen gas + Salt (with negative ion of metal and oxygen) |
| Acid + Metal Carbonate | Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water |
| Acid + Metal Hydrogencarbonate | Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water |
| Acid + Base | Salt + Water (Neutralisation) |

---

## Electrical Conductivity

Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce **hydrogen ions** and **hydroxide ions** respectively.

---

## pH Scale

| pH Range | Nature | Ion Concentration |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| 0-6 | Acidic | High $H^{+}$ concentration |
| 7 | Neutral | Equal $H^{+}$ and $OH^{-}$ |
| 8-14 | Basic/Alkaline | High $OH^{-}$ concentration |

The strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using the **pH scale (0-14)** which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.

---

## Important Facts

1. A **neutral solution** has a pH of exactly **7**
2. An **acidic solution** has a pH **less than 7**
3. A **basic solution** has a pH **more than 7**
4. Living beings carry out their metabolic activities within an **optimal pH range**
5. Mixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a **highly exothermic process**
6. Acids and bases **neutralise** each other to form corresponding salts and water

## Water of Crystallisation

**Definition:** Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt.

| Compound | Formula | Water Molecules |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| Copper sulphate | $CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O$ | 5 |
| Washing soda | $Na_{2}CO_{3}.10H_{2}O$ | 10 |
| Gypsum | $CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O$ | 2 |
| Plaster of Paris | $CaSO_{4}.\frac{1}{2}H_{2}O$ | ½ |

## Uses of Salts

Salts have various uses in everyday life and in industries:

| Salt | Uses |
|------|------|
| **Common salt (NaCl)** | Food, raw material for chemicals |
| **Baking soda ($NaHCO_3$)** | Baking, antacids, fire extinguishers |
| **Washing soda ($Na_2CO_3.10H_2O$)** | Cleaning, water softening, glass industry |
| **Bleaching powder ($CaOCl_2$)** | Bleaching, disinfection |
| **Plaster of Paris** | Fracture support, decoration, toys |

## Quick Revision

1. **Acids** produce $H^{+}(aq)$ or $H_3O^{+}$ ions in water
2. **Bases** produce $OH^{-}(aq)$ ions in water
3. **pH scale** ranges from 0 to 14
4. **Neutralisation:** Acid + Base → Salt + Water
5. **Always add acid to water**, never water to acid
6. **Tooth decay** starts below pH 5.5
7. **Body pH** range: 7.0 to 7.8
8. **Acid rain** has pH less than 5.6
