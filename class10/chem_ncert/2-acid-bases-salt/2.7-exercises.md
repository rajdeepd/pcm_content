## Answers

| Q. No. | Answer | Explanation |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **(d) 10** | A solution that turns red litmus blue is basic. Basic solutions have pH > 7. Among the options, only 10 is greater than 7. |
| 2 | **(b) HCl** | Egg shells contain calcium carbonate. HCl (acid) reacts with $CaCO_3$ to produce $CO_2$ which turns lime water milky. |
| 3 | **(d) 16 mL** | If 10 mL NaOH needs 8 mL HCl, then 20 mL NaOH (double) will need 16 mL HCl (double). |
| 4 | **(c) Antacid** | Antacids neutralise excess stomach acid and provide relief from indigestion. |
| 5 | See below | Balanced equations for acid-metal reactions |
| 6 | See below | Conductivity test using bulb circuit |
| 7 | See below | Rain water contains dissolved acids/salts |
| 8 | See below | Acids need water to produce $H^+$ ions |
| 9 | See below | D is neutral, C is strongly alkaline, B is strongly acidic, A is weakly acidic, E is weakly alkaline |
| 10 | See below | Test tube A (HCl) - HCl is a strong acid |
| 11 | See below | pH decreases as lactic acid is formed |
| 12 | See below | Prevents milk from turning sour quickly |
| 13 | See below | Absorbs moisture and sets into gypsum |
| 14 | See below | Acid + Base → Salt + Water |
| 15 | See below | Various industrial and household uses |

## Detailed Answers

### Q5. Balanced Equations

**(a) Sulphuric acid + Zinc:**
$Zn + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow ZnSO_4 + H_2 \uparrow$

**(b) Hydrochloric acid + Magnesium:**
$Mg + 2HCl \rightarrow MgCl_2 + H_2 \uparrow$

**(c) Sulphuric acid + Aluminium:**
$2Al + 3H_2SO_4 \rightarrow Al_2(SO_4)_3 + 3H_2 \uparrow$

**(d) Hydrochloric acid + Iron:**
$Fe + 2HCl \rightarrow FeCl_2 + H_2 \uparrow$

---

### Q6. Activity to prove alcohols and glucose are not acids

Set up a circuit with a battery, bulb, and two electrodes dipped in the solution. Test with:
- Glucose solution - bulb does not glow
- Alcohol solution - bulb does not glow
- Dilute HCl - bulb glows

This proves that glucose and alcohol do not produce $H^+$ ions in solution, hence they are not acids.

---

### Q7. Conductivity of water

- **Distilled water** does not conduct electricity because it contains no ions.
- **Rain water** conducts electricity because it dissolves gases like $CO_2$, $SO_2$, $NO_2$ from the atmosphere, forming carbonic acid, sulphuric acid, etc., which produce ions.

---

### Q8. Acids in absence of water

Acids produce $H^+$ ions only in the presence of water. In the absence of water, the dissociation of acids into ions does not occur, so they do not show acidic behaviour.

---

### Q9. pH Classification

| Solution | pH | Nature |
|----------|-----|--------|
| D | 7 | Neutral |
| C | 11 | Strongly alkaline |
| B | 1 | Strongly acidic |
| A | 4 | Weakly acidic |
| E | 9 | Weakly alkaline |

**Increasing order of $H^+$ concentration:** C < E < D < A < B (or pH: 11, 9, 7, 4, 1)

---

### Q10. Fizzing in acid reactions

Fizzing will occur **more vigorously in test tube A (HCl)** because HCl is a **strong acid** and produces more $H^+$ ions, while acetic acid is a **weak acid** and produces fewer $H^+$ ions.

---

### Q11. pH change in milk to curd

The pH will **decrease** (become more acidic) as milk turns into curd. This is because bacteria convert lactose (milk sugar) into **lactic acid** during the curdling process.

---

### Q12. Baking soda in milk

(a) The milkman shifts pH to slightly alkaline to **prevent the milk from becoming sour** (acidic) quickly.
(b) This milk takes longer to set as curd because the **lactic acid** produced by bacteria is **neutralised** by the baking soda, delaying the curdling process.

---

### Q13. Storage of Plaster of Paris

Plaster of Paris should be stored in moisture-proof containers because it readily **absorbs moisture** from the atmosphere and gets converted to **gypsum** (a hard mass), making it useless:

$CaSO_4.\frac{1}{2}H_2O + 1\frac{1}{2}H_2O \rightarrow CaSO_4.2H_2O$

---

### Q14. Neutralisation reaction

A neutralisation reaction is a reaction between an acid and a base to form **salt and water**.

**Examples:**
1. $NaOH + HCl \rightarrow NaCl + H_2O$
2. $Ca(OH)_2 + H_2SO_4 \rightarrow CaSO_4 + 2H_2O$

---

### Q15. Uses of washing soda and baking soda

**Washing Soda ($Na_2CO_3.10H_2O$):**
1. Used for removing permanent hardness of water
2. Used in glass, soap and paper industries

**Baking Soda ($NaHCO_3$):**
1. Used for making baking powder (for making cakes, bread soft and spongy)
2. Used as an ingredient in antacids

You can also prepare indicators using red cabbage leaves, coloured petals of Petunia, Hydrangea, and Geranium.

### Activity II: Preparing a Soda-acid Fire Extinguisher

- Take 20 mL of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution in a wash-bottle
- Suspend an ignition tube containing dilute sulphuric acid in the wash-bottle
- Tilt the wash-bottle so that the acid mixes with the sodium hydrogencarbonate solution
- Direct the discharge on a burning candle
- Observe the candle getting extinguished due to $CO_2$ produced
