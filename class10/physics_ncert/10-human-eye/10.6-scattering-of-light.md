# 10.6 Scattering of Light

The interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several spectacular phenomena in nature:
- The **blue colour of the sky**
- Colour of water in **deep sea**
- The **reddening of the sun** at sunrise and sunset

In the previous class, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles. The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible. However, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger.

## 10.6.1 Tyndall Effect

The earth's atmosphere is a **heterogeneous mixture** of minute particles. These particles include:
- Smoke
- Tiny water droplets
- Suspended particles of dust
- Molecules of air

### What is Tyndall Effect?

When a beam of light strikes such fine particles, the path of the beam becomes **visible**. The light reaches us, after being **reflected diffusely** by these particles.

> **Definition:** The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to **Tyndall effect**.

### Examples of Tyndall Effect

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Smoke-filled room** | A fine beam of sunlight enters through a small hole — the path becomes visible |
| **Dense forest** | Sunlight passes through a canopy — tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light |

Thus, **scattering of light makes the particles visible**.

## Dependence on Particle Size

The colour of the scattered light depends on the **size of the scattering particles**:

| Particle Size | Scattered Light |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Very fine particles** | Scatter mainly **blue light** |
| **Larger particles** | Scatter light of **longer wavelengths** |
| **Large enough particles** | Scattered light may appear **white** |

## 10.6.2 Why is the Colour of the Clear Sky Blue?

The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size **smaller than the wavelength of visible light**.

### The Scattering Process

These particles are more effective in scattering:
- Light of **shorter wavelengths** (blue end) — **more strongly**
- Light of **longer wavelengths** (red end) — **less strongly**

> **Note:** The red light has a wavelength about **1.8 times greater** than blue light.

### Result

When sunlight passes through the atmosphere:
1. Fine particles in air scatter the **blue colour** (shorter wavelengths) **more strongly** than red
2. The scattered **blue light enters our eyes**
3. The sky appears **blue**

## What if Earth Had No Atmosphere?

If the earth had no atmosphere:
- There would be **no scattering**
- The sky would look **dark**

> The sky appears **dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes**, as scattering is not prominent at such heights.

## Why are Danger Signals Red?

You might have observed that **'danger' signal lights are red** in colour.

### Reason

**Red light is least scattered** by fog or smoke. Therefore, it can be seen in the **same colour at a distance**.

## Summary

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tyndall Effect** | Scattering of light by colloidal particles making the light beam visible |
| **Blue sky** | Blue light (shorter wavelength) scattered more by atmospheric particles |
| **Dark sky at high altitude** | Less scattering due to thin atmosphere |
| **Red danger signals** | Red light scattered least, visible from far distance |

## Wavelength and Scattering

| Colour | Wavelength | Scattering |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Violet/Blue** | Shorter | More |
| **Red** | Longer | Less |

> Shorter wavelengths are scattered more than longer wavelengths — this is known as **Rayleigh scattering**.
