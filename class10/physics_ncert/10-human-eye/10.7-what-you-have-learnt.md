# 10.7 What You Have Learnt

## Key Points Summary

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|------------|
| **Power of Accommodation** | The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its focal length |
| **Near Point** | The smallest distance at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain (about **25 cm** for a young adult with normal vision) |
| **Common Vision Defects** | Myopia, Hypermetropia, and Presbyopia |

---

## Defects of Vision — Quick Reference

| Defect | Description | Correction |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Myopia** (short-sightedness) | Image of distant objects is focussed **before the retina** | Concave lens of suitable power |
| **Hypermetropia** (far-sightedness) | Image of nearby objects is focussed **beyond the retina** | Convex lens of suitable power |
| **Presbyopia** | Loss of accommodation power with age | Convex lens or bi-focal lenses |

---

## Optical Phenomena

| Phenomenon | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Loss of Accommodation** | The eye loses its power of accommodation at old age |
| **Dispersion** | The splitting of white light into its component colours |
| **Scattering of Light** | Causes the blue colour of sky |

## Important Facts to Remember

1. The human eye is like a **camera** — its lens system forms an image on the retina.

2. **Accommodation** is the ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length to focus on objects at different distances.

3. The **near point** of a normal eye is about **25 cm**.

4. The **far point** of a normal eye is at **infinity**.

5. **Myopia** is corrected using a **concave lens**.

6. **Hypermetropia** is corrected using a **convex lens**.

7. **White light** is composed of **seven colours** (VIBGYOR).

8. **Violet light** is deviated **most** by a prism; **red light** is deviated **least**.

9. The **blue colour of the sky** is due to **scattering of light** by atmospheric particles.

10. **Stars twinkle** due to **atmospheric refraction**, while **planets do not twinkle** because they are extended sources.

11. The Sun is visible about **2 minutes before actual sunrise** and **2 minutes after actual sunset** due to atmospheric refraction.

## Formulae Summary

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| $P = \frac{1}{f}$ | Power of lens (in dioptres, when f is in metres) |
| $\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ | Lens formula |

## Key Terms Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Cornea** | Transparent membrane at the front of the eye |
| **Pupil** | Opening that regulates light entering the eye |
| **Iris** | Coloured muscular diaphragm controlling pupil size |
| **Retina** | Light-sensitive screen where image is formed |
| **Ciliary muscles** | Muscles that change the curvature of the eye lens |
| **Accommodation** | Ability of the eye to adjust focal length |
| **Myopia** | Near-sightedness |
| **Hypermetropia** | Far-sightedness |
| **Presbyopia** | Age-related loss of accommodation |
| **Dispersion** | Splitting of white light into colours |
| **Spectrum** | Band of colours formed by dispersion |
| **Tyndall Effect** | Scattering of light by colloidal particles |
