(d) far-sightedness.

---

**2. The human eye forms the image of an object at its**

(a) cornea.

(c) pupil.
(d) retina.

---

**3. The least distance of distinct vision for a young adult with normal vision is about**

(a) 25 m.
(b) 2.5 cm.
(c) 25 cm.

## Numerical Problems

**5. A person needs a lens of power –5.5 dioptres for correcting his distant vision. For correcting his near vision he needs a lens of power +1.5 dioptre. What is the focal length of the lens required for correcting (i) distant vision, and (ii) near vision?**

---

**6. The far point of a myopic person is 80 cm in front of the eye. What is the nature and power of the lens required to correct the problem?**

---

**7. Make a diagram to show how hypermetropia is corrected. The near point of a hypermetropic eye is 1 m. What is the power of the lens required to correct this defect? Assume that the near point of the normal eye is 25 cm.**

## Short Answer Questions

**8. Why is a normal eye not able to see clearly the objects placed closer than 25 cm?**

---

**9. What happens to the image distance in the eye when we increase the distance of an object from the eye?**

---

**10. Why do stars twinkle?**

---

**11. Explain why the planets do not twinkle.**

## Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | **(b) accommodation** — The eye adjusts the focal length of its lens to focus on objects at different distances. |
| 2 | **(d) retina** — The image is formed on the retina, which is the light-sensitive screen of the eye. |
| 3 | **(c) 25 cm** — This is the least distance of distinct vision (near point) for a normal eye. |
| 4 | **(c) ciliary muscles** — These muscles contract or relax to change the curvature and hence the focal length of the eye lens. |
| 5 | (i) $f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{-5.5}$ m $= -0.182$ m $= -18.2$ cm (concave lens) <br> (ii) $f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{1.5}$ m $= 0.667$ m $= 66.7$ cm (convex lens) |
| 6 | **Concave lens, Power = –1.25 D** <br> Far point = 80 cm = 0.8 m. The lens should form image of distant object (at infinity) at 80 cm. <br> $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-0.8} - \frac{1}{\infty} = -1.25$ D |
| 7 | **Power = +3 D** <br> Near point = 1 m = 100 cm. The lens should form image of object at 25 cm at 100 cm. <br> u = –25 cm, v = –100 cm <br> $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-100} - \frac{1}{-25} = -\frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{25} = \frac{3}{100}$ <br> f = 33.3 cm = 0.333 m, P = +3 D |
| 8 | The ciliary muscles cannot contract beyond a certain limit. Below 25 cm, the eye lens cannot become thick enough to focus the image on the retina. |
| 9 | The image distance in the eye remains constant (equal to the distance between the lens and retina). The focal length of the eye lens increases to keep the image on the retina. |
| 10 | Stars twinkle due to **atmospheric refraction**. Starlight passes through layers of atmosphere with varying density and refractive index. This causes the apparent position and brightness of stars to fluctuate. |
| 11 | Planets are much closer to Earth and appear as **extended sources** (not point sources). The variations in light from different parts of the planet average out, nullifying the twinkling effect. |
| 12 | At very high altitudes, there is **no atmosphere** (or very thin atmosphere) to scatter sunlight. Without scattering, the sky appears **dark** instead of blue. |
