# Answers

## MCQ Answers

<a id="a1"></a>
### Answer 1 [Question ↑](#q1)
**(d) The field consists of concentric circles centred on the wire.**

The magnetic field around a straight current-carrying wire forms concentric circles. The direction of these circles can be determined by the right-hand thumb rule.

---

<a id="a2"></a>
### Answer 2 [Question ↑](#q2)
**(c) increases heavily.**

During a short circuit, the live wire and neutral wire come into direct contact, which reduces the resistance to almost zero. According to Ohm's law (I = V/R), when resistance decreases drastically, the current increases heavily.

---

## True/False Answers

<a id="a3"></a>
### Answer 3 [Question ↑](#q3)

**(a) True**

At the centre of a circular coil carrying current, the magnetic field lines are parallel and straight. This is because the arcs of the concentric circles at the centre appear as straight lines.

**(b) False**

A wire with **green insulation** is the **earth wire**, not the live wire. The live wire has **red insulation**.

| Wire | Colour |
|------|--------|
| Live | Red |
| Neutral | Black |
| Earth | Green |

## Short Answer Solutions

### Answer 4 [Question ↑](#q4)

**Two methods of producing magnetic fields:**

1. **Using a permanent magnet** - A bar magnet or any permanent magnet produces a magnetic field in the surrounding region.

2. **Using electric current** - When electric current flows through a conductor (wire, coil, or solenoid), it produces a magnetic field around it.

---

### Answer 5 [Question ↑](#q5)

The force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field is **largest (maximum)** when the direction of current is **perpendicular (at 90°)** to the direction of the magnetic field.

$F = BIL \sin\theta$

When θ = 90°, sin 90° = 1, so F = BIL (maximum)

---

### Answer 6 [Question ↑](#q6)

The direction of magnetic field is **vertically downward**.

**Explanation:**
- Electron beam moves from back to front (towards you)
- Conventional current direction is opposite to electron flow, i.e., from front to back
- Electron beam deflects to the right
- Applying Fleming's left-hand rule:
  - Middle finger (current): front to back
  - Thumb (force): towards right
  - Forefinger (field): **vertically downward**

### Answer 7 [Question ↑](#q7)

| Part | Rule | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **(i)** | **Right-Hand Thumb Rule** | Hold the conductor in right hand with thumb pointing in direction of current. The fingers curling around the conductor give the direction of magnetic field. |
| **(ii)** | **Fleming's Left-Hand Rule** | Stretch thumb, forefinger, and middle finger mutually perpendicular. Forefinger → Field, Middle finger → Current, Thumb → Force/Motion |
| **(iii)** | **Fleming's Right-Hand Rule** | Stretch thumb, forefinger, and middle finger mutually perpendicular. Thumb → Motion, Forefinger → Field, Middle finger → Induced current |

### Answer 8 [Question ↑](#q8)

An **electric short circuit** occurs when:

1. The **live wire** and **neutral wire** come into **direct contact** with each other.

2. This happens due to:
   - **Damaged insulation** of wires
   - **Fault in the appliance**
   - Loose connections

3. **Effect:** The resistance becomes very low, causing a sudden **heavy increase in current**, which can damage appliances and cause fire.

### Answer 9 [Question ↑](#q9)

**Function of Earth Wire:**

The earth wire provides a **low-resistance conducting path** for the electric current to flow to the earth. It is connected to a metal plate buried deep in the earth.

**Why earthing metallic appliances is necessary:**

1. Metallic appliances (like refrigerator, electric iron) can develop current leakage due to faulty insulation.

2. Without earthing, if a person touches the metallic body, current would pass through the body causing **severe electric shock**.

3. With earthing, the leakage current flows through the earth wire (low resistance path) instead of through the person's body.

4. This keeps the metallic body at **earth potential (zero)**, protecting the user from shock.
