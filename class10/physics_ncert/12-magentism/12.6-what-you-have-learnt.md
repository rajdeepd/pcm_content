# What You Have Learnt

## Magnets and Magnetic Field

- A **compass needle** is a small magnet. Its one end, which points towards north, is called a **north pole**, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a **south pole**.

- A **magnetic field** exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected.

---

## Magnetic Field Lines

- **Field lines** are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along which a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move.

- The **direction of the magnetic field** at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take.

- Field lines are shown **closer together** where the magnetic field is **greater**.

---

## Magnetic Field due to Current

- A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a **magnetic field**.

- The field lines about the wire consist of a series of **concentric circles** whose direction is given by the **right-hand rule**.

- The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor depends on the **shape of the conductor**.

- The magnetic field of a **solenoid** carrying a current is similar to that of a **bar magnet**.

---

## Electromagnet

- An **electromagnet** consists of a core of **soft iron** wrapped around with a coil of **insulated copper wire**.

---

## Force on Current-Carrying Conductor

- A current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field **experiences a force**.

- If the direction of the field and that of the current are **mutually perpendicular** to each other, then the force acting on the conductor will be **perpendicular to both**.

- The direction of force is given by **Fleming's left-hand rule**.

---

## Domestic Electric Circuits

- In our houses we receive **AC electric power** of **220 V** with a frequency of **50 Hz**.

| Wire | Insulation Colour | Description |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Live wire** | Red | At 220 V potential |
| **Neutral wire** | Black | At zero potential |
| **Earth wire** | Green | Connected to metallic body deep inside earth |

- The potential difference between live and neutral is **220 V**.

- Earth wire is used as a **safety measure** to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.

## Safety Device

- **Fuse** is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to **short-circuiting** or **overloading** of the circuits.
