# Answers

## MCQ Answers

<a id="a1"></a>
### Answer 1 [Question ↑](#q1)
**(d) Clay**

A lens must be made of a transparent material that can refract light. Clay is opaque and cannot transmit light, so it cannot be used to make a lens.

---

<a id="a2"></a>
### Answer 2 [Question ↑](#q2)
**(d) Between the pole of the mirror and its principal focus**

When an object is placed between the pole (P) and principal focus (F) of a concave mirror, the image formed is virtual, erect and enlarged.

---

<a id="a3"></a>
### Answer 3 [Question ↑](#q3)
**(b) At twice the focal length (2F)**

When an object is placed at 2F of a convex lens, the image is formed at 2F on the other side, and it is real, inverted and of the same size as the object.

---

<a id="a4"></a>
### Answer 4 [Question ↑](#q4)
**(a) both concave**

- For a **concave mirror**: focal length is negative (f = –15 cm) ✓
- For a **concave lens**: focal length is also negative (f = –15 cm) ✓

Both concave mirror and concave lens have negative focal lengths.

---

<a id="a5"></a>
### Answer 5 [Question ↑](#q5)
**(d) either plane or convex**

- A **plane mirror** always forms a virtual, erect image
- A **convex mirror** always forms a virtual, erect image (diminished)
- A concave mirror can form both real (inverted) and virtual (erect) images depending on object position

---

<a id="a6"></a>
### Answer 6 [Question ↑](#q6)
**(c) A convex lens of focal length 5 cm**

- A convex lens acts as a magnifying glass
- Smaller focal length means higher magnification ($m = 1 + \frac{D}{f}$)
- Therefore, convex lens with f = 5 cm gives maximum magnification

---

## Short Answer Solutions

<a id="a7"></a>
### Answer 7 [Question ↑](#q7)

**Given:** Focal length, f = 15 cm

To get an **erect image** using a concave mirror, the object must be placed **between the pole (P) and the principal focus (F)**.

**Range of object distance:** Between 0 and 15 cm (i.e., less than focal length)

**Nature of image:**
- Virtual
- Erect
- Enlarged (larger than object)

---

<a id="a8"></a>
### Answer 8 [Question ↑](#q8)

| Situation | Mirror Type | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **(a) Headlights of a car** | Concave mirror | The bulb is placed at the focus, and concave mirror produces powerful parallel beam of light |
| **(b) Side/rear-view mirror** | Convex mirror | Convex mirrors give erect, diminished images with a wider field of view |
| **(c) Solar furnace** | Concave mirror | Large concave mirrors converge sunlight at the focus, producing intense heat |

---

<a id="a9"></a>
### Answer 9 [Question ↑](#q9)

**Yes**, the lens will still produce a **complete image** of the object.

**Explanation:**
- Every part of the lens forms a complete image
- When half is covered, light passes through the uncovered half
- The image is still complete but with **reduced brightness** (intensity)
- This is because less light reaches the image

---

<a id="a10"></a>
### Answer 10 [Question ↑](#q10)

**Given:**
- Object height, h = 5 cm
- Object distance, u = –25 cm
- Focal length, f = +10 cm (convex/converging lens)

**Using lens formula:**

$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$

$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{-25} = \frac{1}{10}$

$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{25} = \frac{5-2}{50} = \frac{3}{50}$

$v = \frac{50}{3} = +16.67 \text{ cm}$

**Magnification:**

$m = \frac{v}{u} = \frac{16.67}{-25} = -0.67$

**Image height:**

$h' = m \times h = -0.67 \times 5 = -3.33 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Position:** 16.67 cm on the other side of lens
- **Size:** 3.33 cm (diminished)
- **Nature:** Real and inverted

---

<a id="a11"></a>
### Answer 11 [Question ↑](#q11)

**Given:**
- Focal length, f = –15 cm (concave lens)
- Image distance, v = –10 cm (virtual image, same side)

**Using lens formula:**

$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$

$\frac{1}{-10} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-15}$

$\frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{-10} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{-3+2}{30} = \frac{-1}{30}$

$u = -30 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:** The object is placed **30 cm** in front of the lens.

---

## Numerical Solutions

<a id="a12"></a>
### Answer 12 [Question ↑](#q12)

**Given:**
- Object distance, u = –10 cm
- Focal length, f = +15 cm (convex mirror)

**Using mirror formula:**

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{-10} = \frac{1}{15}$

$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{2+3}{30} = \frac{5}{30} = \frac{1}{6}$

$v = +6 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Position:** 6 cm behind the mirror
- **Nature:** Virtual, erect and diminished

---

<a id="a13"></a>
### Answer 13 [Question ↑](#q13)

Magnification m = +1 means:

1. **Magnitude = 1:** The image size equals the object size (same height)
2. **Positive sign:** The image is virtual and erect
3. The image is formed at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front
4. The image is **laterally inverted**

---

<a id="a14"></a>
### Answer 14 [Question ↑](#q14)

**Given:**
- Object height, h = 5.0 cm
- Object distance, u = –20 cm
- Radius of curvature, R = 30 cm
- Focal length, f = R/2 = +15 cm (convex mirror)

**Using mirror formula:**

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{-20} = \frac{1}{15}$

$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{20} = \frac{4+3}{60} = \frac{7}{60}$

$v = \frac{60}{7} = +8.57 \text{ cm}$

**Magnification:**

$m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{8.57}{-20} = +0.43$

**Image height:**

$h' = m \times h = 0.43 \times 5.0 = 2.14 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Position:** 8.57 cm behind the mirror
- **Nature:** Virtual and erect
- **Size:** 2.14 cm (diminished)

---

<a id="a15"></a>
### Answer 15 [Question ↑](#q15)

**Given:**
- Object height, h = 7.0 cm
- Object distance, u = –27 cm
- Focal length, f = –18 cm (concave mirror)

**Using mirror formula:**

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$

$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{-27} = \frac{1}{-18}$

$\frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{-18} + \frac{1}{27} = \frac{-3+2}{54} = \frac{-1}{54}$

$v = -54 \text{ cm}$

**Magnification:**

$m = -\frac{v}{u} = -\frac{-54}{-27} = -2$

**Image height:**

$h' = m \times h = -2 \times 7.0 = -14.0 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Screen position:** 54 cm in front of the mirror
- **Size:** 14.0 cm (enlarged, twice the object)
- **Nature:** Real and inverted

### Answer 16 [Question ↑](#q16)

**Given:** Power, P = –2.0 D

**Using formula:**

$P = \frac{1}{f}$ (where f is in metres)

$f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{-2.0} = -0.5 \text{ m} = -50 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Focal length:** –50 cm (or –0.5 m)
- **Type:** Concave lens (diverging) — negative focal length indicates concave lens

---

<a id="a17"></a>
### Answer 17 [Question ↑](#q17)

**Given:** Power, P = +1.5 D

**Using formula:**

$P = \frac{1}{f}$ (where f is in metres)

$f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{1.5} = +0.67 \text{ m} = +66.67 \text{ cm}$

**Answer:**
- **Focal length:** +66.67 cm (or +0.67 m)
- **Type:** Convex lens (converging) — positive power indicates converging lens
