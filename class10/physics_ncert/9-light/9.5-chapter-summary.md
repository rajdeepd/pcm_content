# Chapter 9: Light – One Page Summary

## Reflection of Light

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Incident Ray** | Ray falling on a reflecting surface |
| **Reflected Ray** | Ray bouncing back from the surface |
| **Normal** | Perpendicular line at point of incidence |
| **Angle of Incidence (∠i)** | Angle between incident ray and normal |
| **Angle of Reflection (∠r)** | Angle between reflected ray and normal |

**Laws of Reflection:** (1) ∠i = ∠r (2) Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane

## Spherical Mirrors

| Type | Shape | Focus | Image Type |
|------|-------|-------|------------|
| **Concave** | Curved inward | Real (in front) | Real or Virtual |
| **Convex** | Curved outward | Virtual (behind) | Always Virtual |

**Key Terms:** Pole (P), Centre of Curvature (C), Principal Focus (F), Focal Length (f), Radius of Curvature (R)

**Relationship:** $f = \frac{R}{2}$

### Mirror Formula & Magnification

| Formula | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **Mirror Formula** | $\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ |
| **Magnification** | $m = \frac{h'}{h} = -\frac{v}{u}$ |

### Image Formation Summary

| Mirror | Object Position | Image | Nature |
|--------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Concave | Beyond C | Between F & C | Real, inverted, diminished |
| Concave | At C | At C | Real, inverted, same size |
| Concave | Between F & C | Beyond C | Real, inverted, enlarged |
| Concave | Between P & F | Behind mirror | Virtual, erect, enlarged |
| Convex | Anywhere | Between P & F | Virtual, erect, diminished |

### Uses

| Concave Mirror | Convex Mirror |
|----------------|---------------|
| Torches, headlights | Rear-view mirrors |
| Shaving mirrors | Security mirrors |
| Solar furnaces | Street light reflectors |
| Dentist mirrors | |

## Refraction of Light

**Definition:** Bending of light when passing from one medium to another

**Laws of Refraction (Snell's Law):**
1. Incident ray, refracted ray, and normal lie in the same plane
2. $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = n_{21}$ (constant)

### Refractive Index

| Formula | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| $n = \frac{c}{v}$ | Absolute refractive index |
| $n_{21} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$ | Relative refractive index |

**Common Values:** Air ≈ 1.0, Water = 1.33, Glass = 1.5, Diamond = 2.42

| Light travels from | Bends | Speed |
|--------------------|-------|-------|
| Rarer → Denser | Towards normal | Decreases |
| Denser → Rarer | Away from normal | Increases |

## Lenses

| Type | Shape | Action | Focal Length |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Convex** | Thick at centre | Converges light | Positive (+) |
| **Concave** | Thin at centre | Diverges light | Negative (–) |

### Lens Formula & Magnification

| Formula | Expression |
|---------|------------|
| **Lens Formula** | $\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ |
| **Magnification** | $m = \frac{h'}{h} = \frac{v}{u}$ |
| **Power of Lens** | $P = \frac{1}{f}$ (in metres), Unit: Dioptre (D) |

### Image Formation Summary

| Lens | Object Position | Image | Nature |
|------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Convex | Beyond 2F | Between F & 2F | Real, inverted, diminished |
| Convex | At 2F | At 2F | Real, inverted, same size |
| Convex | Between F & 2F | Beyond 2F | Real, inverted, enlarged |
| Convex | Between F & O | Same side | Virtual, erect, enlarged |
| Concave | Anywhere | Between F & O | Virtual, erect, diminished |

## Sign Convention (New Cartesian)

| Measurement | Sign |
|-------------|------|
| Distances along incident light | **Positive (+)** |
| Distances opposite to incident light | **Negative (–)** |
| Heights above principal axis | **Positive (+)** |
| Heights below principal axis | **Negative (–)** |
| Object distance (u) | Always **negative** |
| Focal length: Concave mirror/lens | **Negative** |
| Focal length: Convex mirror/lens | **Positive** |

## Key Formulas at a Glance

| Mirror/Lens | Formula |
|-------------|---------|
| Mirror Formula | $\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ |
| Lens Formula | $\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$ |
| Magnification (Mirror) | $m = -\frac{v}{u}$ |
| Magnification (Lens) | $m = \frac{v}{u}$ |
| Focal Length | $f = \frac{R}{2}$ |
| Power | $P = \frac{1}{f}$ (D) |
| Snell's Law | $n = \frac{\sin i}{\sin r}$ |
| Refractive Index | $n = \frac{c}{v}$ |

## Quick Tips for Problem Solving

1. **Always apply sign convention first** before substituting values
2. **Object distance (u) is always negative** (object on left)
3. **Positive v** = image on opposite side (real for lens, virtual for mirror)
4. **Negative v** = image on same side (virtual for lens, real for mirror)
5. **m > 0** = erect image, **m < 0** = inverted image
6. **|m| > 1** = enlarged, **|m| < 1** = diminished
