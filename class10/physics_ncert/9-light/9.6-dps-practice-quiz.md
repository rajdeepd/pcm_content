## Answers

| Question | Answer | Explanation |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **(b)** | Only a **concave mirror** can produce a real image for a real object (when object is beyond F). Plane mirrors, convex mirrors, and concave lenses always produce virtual images. |
| 2 | **(a)** | For erect image with $m = 1.5$, using $m = -\frac{v}{u}$ with $u = -25$ cm gives $v = 37.5$ cm. Using mirror formula: $\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{37.5} + \frac{1}{-25}$, we get $f = 75$ cm. |
| 3 | **(b)** | Refractive index $n = \frac{c}{v}$ where $c$ is speed of light in vacuum and $v$ is speed in medium. Since $n > 1$, speed in vacuum must be greater than speed in medium. |
| 4 | **(c)** | The lens still forms a complete image of the horse (not stripes), but with reduced brightness since some light is blocked by the black paint. |
| 5 | **(a) and (d)** | $P = \frac{1}{f}$. Convex lens: positive power, so +4 D → $f = 0.25$ m ✓. Concave lens: negative power, so -4 D → $f = -0.25$ m ✓ |
| 6 | **(c)** | Enlarged image → concave mirror (object between F and P). Same size → plane mirror. Diminished image → convex mirror. Order: **Concave, plane and convex**. |
| 7 | **(a)** | When light changes medium, **frequency remains constant** while **wavelength and velocity change**. |
| 8 | **(c)** | Combined power $P = P_1 + P_2 = +3 + (-1) = +2$ D. Focal length $f = \frac{1}{P} = \frac{1}{2}$ m $= 50$ cm. |
| 9 | **(d)** | For inverted image with $m = -2$: $v = 2u$. Using mirror formula with $f = -50$ cm: $\frac{1}{2u} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{-1}{50}$, solving gives $u = -75$ cm. Object at **75 cm**. |
| 10 | **(d)** | $n_{glass/water} = \frac{n_{glass}}{n_{water}} = \frac{3/2}{4/3} = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{8}$ |
